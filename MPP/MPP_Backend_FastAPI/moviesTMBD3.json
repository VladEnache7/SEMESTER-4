But Odette is bound by a spell which keeps her captive as a swan during the day. Can Siegfried free her?  Tchaikovsky’s sensational score combines with the evocative imagination of choreographer Liam Scarlett and designer John Macfarlane to heighten the dramatic pathos of Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov’s quintessential ballet classic. Opening in Spring and returning in Summer, Swan Lake remains to this day one of the best-loved works in the classical ballet canon."

After hellish drivers, new careerists, the third world war. In vain, he urged his own, but also all future generations not to whine. \"Made in Pula\", by Rada Đurić, is a film that reminds and believes. He owes it to all those who do not give up."

Attendees delight in sharing their sometimes obscure & sometimes popular musical (& otherwise) loves.  For mm 49 (in the 37th month of \"mm\" s history) a marathon listening party celebrating the music of Vivian Fine was decided upon.  Fine was a dedicated composer who produced a variety of work over a 70 year career. This movie, of course, is not an imitation of Ken Burns style documentary movie-making.  Instead, I gleefully mix the casualness & lively uninhibited conversation of mms with the formal exactitude of Fine s music.  I hope you enjoy it as an upstanding example of Punk Classical.  \"Bah to the Bourgeoisie\"!  Note that I m starting to disappear in this movie - will you miss me when I m gone?  This is my 111th feature & my 404th movie."

Chaos and precision. Distorted introspection and warm, dreamlike expanse. Conceived in 1999 by Bruce Soord, the progressive quartet underwent a rebirth in 2017 with the arrival of Gavin Harrison on drums. Completed by bassist Jon Sykes and keyboardist Steve Kitch, they’ve honed a lean yet lush, quietly timeless sound that soars on It Leads To This.  Comprising eight fat-free epics – mixing rock urgency with delicate atmospherics, pensive keys and captivating melodies – it finds Soord looking back and fearing for the world his children will inherit. His lyrics also drew from literature: accounts of Ancient Rome, John Williams’ classic Stoner and epistolary Augustus. All conveyed through Soord’s fragile yet penetrative tenor, nodding to storytellers like Nick Drake, Thom Yorke and Katatonia’s Jonas Renkse."

After two fairly raw trio albums, the band set up camp in February of 2015 at legendary Sunset Sound studios in Hollywood, CA, where Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones and Van Halen all recorded landmark albums. The result: Nine new compositions of greater sonic depth and breadth than ever before, with unique textures and lush layering augmenting the band’s preternatural ability to improvise both individually and as a group at the highest levels possible. But not to worry – it was all still tempered with a steadfast refusal to take themselves too seriously, and The Aristocrats were still having more fun than a fusion band has any right to have."

The work is about the victory of the Venetians at the siege of Corfu, which acted as a catalyst in stopping the Ottoman advance into the Christian West. Juditha triumphans is the only extant oratorio of the four Vivaldi is known to have composed. The intense war atmosphere is portrayed through the dynamic choral parts, while Juditha’s faith and honesty through the lyric and tender writing. Remarkable is the use of many different and relatively rare instruments, such as the viola d’amore, the chalumeaux (early clarinets) and theorboes, with which Vivaldi brings out the work’s highlights."

It was also some 45 years after the band famously performed at the venue (captured for posterity on the Greasy Truckers Party album), where they recorded the hit version of ‘Silver Machine’.  Six months on, this amazing, historic show is captured for posterity within a deluxe, celebratory box set, which boasts audio and audio-visual versions of the entire performance. The set-list blends highlights from Hawkwind’s last two acclaimed, Top 40 albums The Machine Stops and Into The Woods with classics from the band’s past.  The show climaxed with guest guitarist Phil ‘Wizzo’ Campbell (Motörhead, The Bastard Sons) joining the band for encore performances of ‘Brainbox Pollution’ and ‘Silver Machine’, the hit version of which was recorded at the Roundhouse back in 1972."

The most famous and popular is his third opera, Susannah, premiered in 1955 and the second most preformed in all American operas. Updated and set in Tennessee, it is loosely based on the Apocryphal tale of Susannah and the Elders. The work is rooted in vernacular folk melodies, hymns, and contains soaring melodic beauty.”  In the opera  Susannah;’ Susannah Polk becomes the target of false accusations and scandalous rumors spread by the local church community. Her innocence is challenged, leading to tragic consequences as Susannah fights to defend her honor and integrity in the face of small-town prejudice and bigotry."

Schiff describes Piano Concerto No. 1 in C major, Op. 15 from 1795 as “absolutely huge in its concept for that time. I ve always thought that there s something Shakespearean about Beethoven in the way comedy, tragedy, drama, and tenderness are all present at the same time.”  Filmed in black and white, this concert is a beautiful showcase of craftsmanship and musicality. Schiff sits at a period-accurate recreation of a historic 1822 fortepiano crafted by Conrad Graf. He is joined by The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment for a captivating, historically informed, performance.  This concert was filmed on 6 June 2022 at Southbank Centre’s Queen Elizabeth Hall in London."

It s definitely a must for any fan of the band as it captures the true essence of a Municipal Waste show, with crazy stage-diving, raucous circle pits, comic inflatable sharks and rapping wizards adding to the musical mayhem."

Bach’s Prelude in B-flat minor, which incidentally is played throughout the journey of the protagonist, the “leaf”. The timeless rhythms of Bach’s genius resonate, that immortal genius who centuries ago left his legacy on the eternal “leaves” of his scores, transcending time."

Following the huge success of Korngold’s Das Wunder der Heliane (Naxos DVD 2.110584–85 / Blu-ray NBD0083V), director Christof Loy continues his exploration of strong female characters and neglected 20th-century masterpieces with this highly acclaimed Deutsche Oper Berlin production."

Outside of any promotional context, the present-day heralds of French hip-hop, from La Rumeur to IAM, speak about the role of rap, the environment in which it was born, boredom, the feeling of belonging to a sacrificed generation, drugs in districts of towns, immigration, parents, political and social actors, the police, school, writing, money, the parallel economy, violence..."

In order to attend the concert, VaXz travels from Bosilegrad to Belgrade sometimes up to ten hours, and then returns, sometimes immediately after listening to the gig. In this film, we meet Vladan and what it is that inspires him about hardcore, but through his portrait we also get to know life in a small town like Bosilegrad, as well as the history of hardcore music in Serbia and how bands came together to honor their most loyal fan."

So he sets off on an adventurous journey, always following the bottle to find it. Along the way, he meets Luigi Ferrari, a cheerful fellow who lives in a remote mountain hut. Franco uses a trick to persuade him to become his travelling companion. Together they get into all sorts of funny and dangerous situations due to the unpredictable directions the bottle takes them.

These practices are presented through the lens of a musical family trained during Bulgaria s communist regime (1944-1989) to represent the best that Bulgaria had to offer the world, but who made the wrenching decision in the post-communist period to immigrate to the United States for the sake of their daughters  futures. From that vantage point they have been able to teach their art to, and \"fill the souls\" of, singers, dancers, musicians, and audiences all over the world."

    "description": "Without question, this is an incredibly bizarre production. The revised storyline makes little sense, and there is a surprising amount of violence and sexual innuendo. However, the singers are superb, both vocally and in regard to their stage presence and acting, the orchestra plays beautifully, the chorus is wonderful, and the set is as clever as it is strange. It s definitely not for purists, or for someone new to this particular opera. But for someone who s seen Die Entfuhrung before, and is familiar enough with the original story to not miss it, watching Belmonte, Constanze, Blonde, Pedrillo, and Osmin embark on an entirely new adventure -- and push the boundaries of good taste -- is rather enjoyable."

Fourty thousand feet of celluloid later, the result is  Welcome To The Cheap Seats . A rock  n  roll experience nestling somewhere between  Slade In Flame  and  Coronation Street .  The Stuffies swap insights for insults as they discover Tartan, Polka Dot and Stadium Rock in a tale that captures the band on stage and off-guard. The ten-legged s adventures canter to a soundtrack bustling with old favourites, brand new tunes, and a few classic humdingers they wish they d penned.  The film offers but a brief glimpse into the hurly burly, hussle bussle, day to day life of ordinary rock folk. Play Loud!"

With a masterful production we attended the band s most important concert after their latest album, \"Cable a Tierra\", an album in which the group brings its sound closer to the folklore of here and Latin America to explore new rhythms and take our roots to the rock, pop and electronica. Between songs, the members of the group tell us how the album was created and the night of the concert. Accompanied by El Naán, Alibori and the rapper Wos and by unusual traditional instruments in events of this magnitude, the band performed their sixth studio album and their best-known songs in a concert that has already become a must-see music event in Spain."

The ensemble featured Admiral Fallow’s Sarah Hayes on flute and piano, leading lights of North East jazz, Faye MacCalman and John Pope, on saxophone/clarinet and double bass, strings from regular collaborators The Crude Tarmac Quartet, Alan Hull, award-winning singer Eve Cole and David’s brother Peter on drums."

The little sister envies her sibling’s achievements but what she does impulsively has caused permanent harm to the family. Besides Siao and Au, Woo Fung, still an active TV actor today, took up the role of Au’s once boyfriend, and Fanny Fan Lai and Roy Chiao, well-known for their roles in Mandarin films, took a bold step to partake in this Cantonese film. Director Chu Kea, best known for his period dramas, turned to a contemporary-set film this time, and successfully delivered the film’s sense of modernity, probably with help from his co-directors Ho Hoi-ki and Chu Yat-hung, who was his sister. The opening scene of an orchestra performance even reminds the audience of Hollywood movies."

It’s a selection that covers those early days when Fun Boy Three first introduced pop fans to the original line-up of Keren Woodward, Sara Dallin and Siobhan Fahey, as well as the end of the 1980s when Siobhan left and was replaced by Jacquie O’Sullivan.  We also bring things right up to date and feature the band’s current status as a duo, with Sara and Keren keeping the flame alive. Over all those years, Bananarama have never claimed to be the greatest singers or dancers, but together they somehow still created pop magic – so fans, settle back and witness how their durability proves beyond doubt that It Ain’t What You Do, it’s the Way That You Do It."

The song in the video is Love Song: Ar-ra-rang 1 recorded on a wax cylinder in 1896 by American anthropologist Alice Fletcher, who requested its performance by three Korean students in Washington at the time. This was apparently the first example in the history of Korean traditional music being captured with a recording medium."

During the film they perform music from ‘every day melodies’ series composed by Kirill Shirokov.  The movie is the first part of mini-series discovering the territory of contemporary art music."

How Did We Find Ourselves Here? chronicles the band s journey from their early beginnings, through conflicts with former friends, battles with major record labels, and disbandment, to their eventual reunion in 2012. Despite never achieving widespread commercial success, the band maintains a devoted fanbase and commands great respect from musicians around the globe for their significant influence."

Although I didn’t understand exactly, since the wide screen gives a different feeling. The quality of the video recording, in my opinion, is much worse than 4:3, but I did not closely compare. This DVD can only be of interest to true fans of Donna Summer, who want to have a favorite in all variants and angles."

    "description": "An intimate musical portrait of a reclusive gipsy community in the South of France, which has produced world-famous musicians, yet remains largely unknown to the outside world.  The film tells the story of three families, linked through ties of blood and music: the Reyes, famous as the Gipsy Kings; the Balliardo, descendants of Manitas de Plata; and their cousins the Regis, reclusive adepts of flamenco puro. Through cinematic imagery, poetic narrative, intimate musical performances, and moving glimpses of day to day life, we learn to understand the mindset of these unique people to whom fame and fortune have no value, and little matters but music and family.  Shot in 4K and featuring over 20 musical performances, the film is a rare treat for anyone who likes flamenco guitar or the Gipsy Kings."

The Soldier field show was filled with favorites, including “Shakedown Street,”“Brown-Eyed Women,” “Playing In The Band,” “Terrapin Station,” and “Dark Star.” From the original six-camera video feed that appeared on the stadium s big screens and the pristine soundboard audio, Chicago 6/22/91 is an incredible performance start-to-finish."

He conquered the Parisian salons with passionate performances marked by excellent technique and handsome features that became the downfall of many women. But what was he truly after? The musical narrates the story of Liszt s early years, and his pilgrimage across Europe in an attempt to find a place where his soul could belong, focusing on the romance with the Countess Marie d Agoult, and his greatest friend and rival, Chopin.  FASHIONABLE EMPIRE: A revue that transforms the stage into the \"Empire\" where the pioneering fashionistas of our time gather. The stylish array of scenes will enchant the audience, at times with the cool atmosphere, and at times with the hot beats. While focusing on the sophisticated and metropolitan appeal of top star Yuzuka Rei this revue also shows off the unique, scintillating members of Flower Troupe through many groovy scenes."

Both daring and experimental, the film transcends all boundaries and conventions: It is a meandering ode to the absurdity and fragility of life, a profound meditation on the human condition, a dreamlike tapestry of lingering vignettes about past and present, remembrance and oblivion. With his trademark wit and sensitivity, Schnibuli crafts a haunting and ethereal hymn to nature s beauty and human intimacy, all underscored by the gentle rustling of leaves, the babbling of streams, the hum of Günther s remarkable baritone. Those who embrace this thought-provoking and inspiring opportunity to rediscover their lives in the subjunctive will lose themselves and find themselves again – a true testament to the possibilities of cinema!"

In the 1960’s, I made several films that used oscilloscope imagery and, in doing so, learned to ‘play’ various synthesizers to generate images. For this film, I used colored gels while filming and chose to optically print a few visual phrases, allowing for repeated sections. I also super-imposed hi-contrast notation over the film. So, Sections became a kind of feedback piece: sound generated the images for the score and performers created new sounds and a new piece from these images.” (Richard Lerman)"

She would play songs from previous albums, including “Cactus Tree” from her 1968 David Crosby–produced debut and “Chelsea Morning” from Clouds, but the majority of her 11-song set came from her then-new album, Ladies of the Canyon. With tracks like “Big Yellow Taxi” and “The Circle Game” — the latter her response to Neil Young’s “Sugar Mountain” — Ladies of the Canyon marked Mitchell’s first platinum record. It was also her first to feature the piano, an instrument she’d use to produce warm, introspective songs less than a year later on Blue."

These gatherings brought fans together to share their experiences and resources, and to find support through the IAMX community."

Tennstedt s live performances are much better than his studio versions of the same works, and it s wonderful to watch him coaxing what he wants from the players. Even though he conducts from the score rather than from memory, he always seems to be directly connected to the orchestra in an almost magical way. The sound is good in both performances, and there is a sense, on both occasions, of being present for something quite special. These are great performances."

Through two radically contrasting 2016 productions - a traditional 19th-century recreation, and a gritty reimagining of the work by celebrated Anglo-Bangladeshi choreographer Akram Khan - Rojo examines the cultural and social background to the ballet’s genesis in 1840s Paris, and the spiritual themes that have fuelled its success over the last 175 years. Giselle is the story of a young peasant girl who personifies all that is good in life, and ultimately forgives the aristocrat who has seduced and betrayed her. With Giselle, the look and emotional heart of ballet was transformed forever, from mime-based storytelling to a fusion of emotion, music and movement, formulating a tradition that has inspired audiences, dancers and choreographers ever since."

The musician switches between vocals, clarinet and piano with amazing ease. But apart from that, Angel Bat Dawid is able to breathe a highly spiritual dimension into her music like no other, so that her jazz almost borders on gospel. Listening to the multi-instrumentalist therefore sometimes has something of a transcendental experience, at times reminiscent of the music of Sun Ra.  This concert at Ground Control reveals all the artistic glory of their music. Recording of July 4, 2022 at Ground Control, Paris."

At that time, pop music fans in the UK were unlikely to hear black music on mainstream radio, and names like Stevie Wonder and Smokey Robinson still meant nothing to most British people, but thousands of miles away from where these exciting new sounds were being recorded in Detroit, a small group of dedicated British music fans had stumbled across the songs and began championing its artists."

Anyway, I had the map in my grasp when that rotten scallywag Galifray took it right from under my nose.  Somehow the  scoundrel managed to trade it for a dragon bracelet. Harold also threw in a magic genie lamp for good luck! I don t know how Galifray does it but he sure has the gift of the gab.

In most of these songs, Anderson plays the violin, accompanied by her own singing and an audiotape (with spoken text, more singing or more violin music). Her songs are often combined with a film projection: she is framed by the light from the projection, and is playing with the shadows cast by her body and her violin. Anderson makes experimental music, and she often find solutions in technological inventions, as with the song  a man, a woman, a house and a tree . The music for this piece is created with the help of a ‘slow-scan’ machine, which registers visual information and transforms this into sound. These experiments are not only about music, but also abou language: anagrams, play on words and poetic stories. The introductory anecdotes that Anderson tells are just as important as the song itself."

Hildegard of Bingen, Francesca Caccini, Clara Schumann, Florence Price and Elizabeth Maconchy - all these women battled to fulfill their ambitions and overcome the obstacles that society placed in their way. They then disappeared into obscurity, and only some have found recognition again."

But she did make it on the world stage – with her recognizable costume and same opening line that never grew tiresome.  The legacy she left was one of compassion, empowerment and innovation. But mostly she made us laugh.  This is her story… simple, yet complicated.  A permanent fixture in country music yet music was clearly not her gift."

The opera \"The Peony Pavilion\" was composed in 1598 by the poet Tang Xianzu (1550-1617), one of the greatest playwrights of the Ming period. Of all the forms of Chinese opera that have followed one another since the 12th century, the kunqu is the one that best preserves the image of a classical art highly appreciated in educated circles for its musical, literary and gestural refinement."

Spanning six screens that encircle the room, the installation surrounds viewers with a performance of spatial music written for eight dancers with eight guitars. Recorded from the center of the performers’ space, the installation is kaleidoscopic, capturing the dancers as they weave within each screen and across the channels; their movements and melodies ranging from pastorale to rock and roll. Combining a variety of classic Western references – blue jeans and white t-shirts, the draped silk curtains of mid-20th century song and dance films, as well as lyrics drawn from the Archaic Greek poet Sappho and adventurer Vivant Denon, two sensualists millennia apart – the work spins notions of idealization and iconography."

And, for the true fan, a 45-minute long hidden \"Easter egg\" showcases an entire concert by Faxed Head s long-time nemesis, pitiful Coalinga-area boogie-blues idiots The Bon Larvis Band."

Online solutions such as Zoom helped groups socially, but did not allow a choir to rehearse and perform together. Several tech-savvy musicians turned to old-school audio technology to organize parking lot choirs, with each singer safely isolated in their own car. The idea spread through social media across the US and Canada, and reached the attention of the New York Times, the Today Show, and NPR. \"The Drive to Sing\" tells the story of the parking lot choir, the cast of characters who worked together to develop and refine it, and the singers who kept their musical communities going during this time of fear and isolation."

A Night of A Thousand Vampires teams the band with the cast of The Circus of Horrors for an evening of shock, awe, and a fierce live rampage through their 40-year rich catalogue. A true event from showmen supreme, it was a historic night in the history of a storied band and a memorable evening for fans and band alike. It was also a fond farewell for drummer Pinch, his final gig with The Dammed after 20 years."

Chailly s interpretation with the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra is  intensely great  (Die Presse).  Chailly uncompromisingly considers this sixth symphony through the lens of modernity; looking forward, not retrospectively staying in late romantic. In this celebrated orchestra, all sections splendidly come together and fulfill an  open  sound, conserving whilst respecting its original beauty  (Salzburger Nachrichten)."

The Adagietto is a revelation, a spiritual oasis. It is not an expression of pain, but rather Mahler s declaration of love to Alma a song without words.\" With the Gewandhaus Orchestra, Chailly gives the piece an unsurpassed intensity of sound and emotional expression. He achieves a compelling arc of tension in which the symphony s unique fascination unfolds. The Wiener Zeitung characterized Chailly s interpretation as \"impressive with powerful and unreserved intensity.\""

Why do we love others if love can hurt us so much? Wouldn’t it be safer not to love? In this documentary, several people who have been profoundly confronted with love and death in their lives, provide glimpses of the enigma of love, based on their personal stories. On Freud’s famous couch, they are questioned about their experiences. Their stories are interwoven with timeless works from the history of painting and music. When words are not adequate, there is art and music."

He’s been produced by XTC’s Andy Partridge, and written for the likes of Captain Sensible of The Damned. Though it would be wrong to call him an \"unknown\", he has never been directly in the limelight. This film brings to light the amazing career and life work of the artist, who, on top of being the most published contemporary British poet as well as an established gardener, continues to record and release music today."

By 1978 they were a behemoth of the local rock scene and on the path to international success… until they just missed their chance. Yet they still revolutionised the Aussie music scene transforming it from pretty pop to gritty guitar rock featuring ferocious and theatrical live shows. Adelaide director Maddie Parry (Hannah Gadsby: Nanette) has made a surprisingly intimate documentary, with band members’ home videos and never-before-seen photos, exploring the internal tensions that strained relationships to breaking point, even while producing incandescent rock’n’roll.  - AFF"

Making a career made no sense, the precariousness of living conditions was swept away by the tremendous enthusiasm that fed all the musiciens on the Nancy micro-scene. To document this period, Otomo de Manuel plunged into his own archives, nourished by 40 years of activism, as an artist and organizer."

The political situation in the Vienna of 1933 and the fact that Krenek was despised by the Nazis because of this Jazz opera Jonny spielt auf, prevented the première. It only took place five years later in Prague, however Krenek had already emigrated to the USA. Karl V was the last emperor to hold to the idea of a Christian empire in which the sun never set, although its downfall was always inevitable, for numerous reasons. For the second production of Karl V. in the Nationaltheater, Carlus Padrissa in particular seeks out political power systems that are highly topical, and so very precisely analyses the treatment in the theatrical piece. At the core of the intellectually and linguistically highly qualified libretto, written by the composer himself, Karl V. reflects on his life and makes his confession to a young monk below Titian s La Gloria."

Boris Petkovič explores in great detail the evolution of a music style which, from the very start, has intimately reflected the social situation of its artists. Hip hop has always absorbed the \"vibes\" of the place where it is taking root, and Slovenia is no exception. According to Petkovič, in today s Slovenia, rap is the one and only form of music that discusses the state of our society and of human relationships without any inhibitions. If rap is not your cup of tea, this film can make you change your mind."

This is a fantasy tale about a young Zulu who leaves his village to go to the city, falls in love with the new music he hears there, and returns home to form a Zulu jazz band – which then goes to the city to compete with other bands, and comes out on top. As in the earlier films, the impact of American jazz and popular music is enormous.  Like African Jim and Zonk!, Song of Africa draws on the best talent from the townships. Director Emil Nofal and director of photography Dave Millin ensure high production values, making it an above-average B-movie."

The Mindelsee lake situated just a few hundred yards away from the gallery became the natural focus of the installation. During their stay, Sabine and Rutger recorded the video and audio footage that became the foundation which Steve Roden responded to with material inspired by his surroundings in the US. It resulted in an immersive four-channel audio-visual presentation, in a gallery space also showing additional visual works by each of the artists, and the floor covered with dried leaves."

The haughty princess complains to her father the emperor, expecting him to exact punishment on Guo Ai for what she regarded as abuse. The wise and benevolent emperor devises a plan to teach both Guo Ai and his daughter a lesson. This is the sole surviving Singapore-made Hokkien (Amoy dialect) film out of only three, and was the first and only Hokkien opera film wholly funded and produced by Singapore or Malaya film companies and talents. It was an unprecedented venture by local arts and cultural groups to document the vernacular Chinese traditional performing arts through cinema. The cast were renowned opera performers from the popular Sin Kee Lin Hokkien Opera Troupe."

This statement encapsulates great operatic themes, and it is the culmination of an opera that reveals the passions of characters who live among palace intrigues. Written in the mature period of the leader of Italian romanticism, the opera displays a great vocal virtuosity, and is an example of Donizetti prizing the voice above all in the genre. The staging, by South African director Alessandro Talevi, who has been very successful in great opera houses as well as with more experimental theatre, places the play in an undetermined period, focusing on the chiaroscuro. Bruno Campanella conducts."

In his setting composer Kim André Arnesen expresses the feelings Mary must have felt: wonder, devotion, gratitude, joy, humility, hope and compassion. God s selection of an unknown woman living in poverty to be the mother of His son is a bottom-up view of the world if ever there was one – and Arnesen sees the Magnificat as offering support and hope for all people struggling against adversity or in need of strength. MUSICA CELESTIS portrays the ceaseless praising of God by angels in heaven. Aaron Jay Kernis builds his work around a fairly simple melody which he remoulds in a series of variations."

The production revolves around three great French composers who inspired NYCB founder George Balanchine: Charles Gounod, Maurice Ravel and Georges Bizet. The four ballets performed encapsulate Balanchine’s genius and his very own neo-classical style, they also provide a particular insight on the bonds that tied Balanchine to France. What is known today as Walpurgisnacht Ballet was a ballet choreographed for the opera Faust at the Paris Opera in 1975, it premiered as an independent piece in New York in 1980. Sonatine set to a music by Maurice Ravel, was created by two New York City Ballet s French principals, the recently departed Violette Verdy and Jean-Pierre Bonnefoux. La Valse was originally composed by Ravel for the Ballets Russes and Serge Diaghilev, then exiled in France, shortly before Balanchine entered the company. Symphony in C better known as Le Palais de Cristal, premiered at the Paris Opera."

As a child Ali never learned to read or write, but his early passion for a home-made one-string, violin-like instrument led him away from his humble roots to the music festivals of Europe in the 60’s. Critics and fans alike have compared his music to the Soul-Blues magic of greats like B.B. King, John Lee Hooker...even Eric Clapton. Ironically he had never heard their “sound” before creating his music. Amazingly, his sound is authentic Blues....and through it, we can hear the native roots, the origins of the Afro-centric rhythms found in Soul, Blues and Jazz! These Afro-centric sounds, which found their way across the seas to America during the era of slavery, preserved and transformed into modern Jazz, are the essence of Ali’s music."

Opening with an extended and haunting rendition of Mockingbird, the guitars of John Lees and Colin Browne blend magnificently on Medicine Man and Play to the World, with Les Holroyd rendering a dramatic vocal performance on the latter. BJH’s more ponderous progressive rock set pieces are pierced by the rousing upbeat guitar-based Life Is for the Living and the crowd pleasing Stand Up."

Using a striking visual style, director Francois Girard ( The Red Violin  and  Thirty-Two Short Films about Glenn Gould ) places Yo-Yo Ma within a series of computer-generated, three-dimensional recreations of Piranesi s well-known prison etchings.  Through Yo-Yo Ma s and music producer Steven Epstein s struggle to recreate and interact with the imaginary space that Ma performs in, the film examines the complexity of illusion, of representation and reality."

Why does the collective body abdicates its moral and political responsibilities and surrenders them to a single individual? And when does the providential man stops being a savior and becomes a threat?"

His 1996 album Straight Up, with bassist Christian McBride and drummer Brian Blade, and 2004’s Take It from the Top, with bassist James Genus and drummer Billy Kilson, are career highlights and gems of their genre. Those records will never escape the shadow of 1978’s Touchdown or 1975’s One, but now James gives us the best of both worlds, revisiting his biggest hits in a trio format and tossing in other tunes.  Despite its title, Feel Like Making LIVE! isn’t a concert recording. It was recorded “live in the studio” with old pal Kilson and young bassist Michael Palazzolo, who’s been in James’ bands for several years now. Rather than swing like a bop trio, they play classy, R&B- and pop-tinged jazz that’s both accessible and adventurous."

One of the world’s foremost exponents of Afro-Latin music, Santos, through his mixed Puerto Rican & Cape Verdean heritage, musical storytelling and legendary percussion classes, strives to unite and expand his kaleidoscopic audience."

And one to one, two to four, tens to hundreds, and \"one\" will be \"we\" again.  \"To dress in Latvian signs\" (\"Latvju zīmēs rotāties\") is a special and unique event in the history of Latvian stage folk dance, because instead of the usual stadium or stage format, the signs are arranged in a digital environment, merging hundreds of dancers with tradition, animations and editing possibilities. Also, what has been unprecedented in the context of stage folk dance is the sound quality with which this performance offers to listen to 15 original compositions based on folk lyrics by Mārtiņš Miļevsks."

There he was on the Austin City Limits stage on November 11, 1975, in his finest rhinestone suit with fur-lined guitar strap, bounding through his entire catalogue of double-entendre ditties. The band never sounded better (nor looked, well, weirder). The audience loved every lyrically devilish twist. There was only one problem. They said it couldn t be aired.

A wonderful evening with the great songs of this artist, who has been traveling around the world for over half a century with his guitar, his stories and songs. The man, whose voice is so incomparably warm and deep, whose guitar playing is so puristic, yet so full and expressive, and whose wonderfully simple lyrics base always on deep thoughts and a touch of melancholy."

It is Rossini‘s first collaboration with Felice Romani - Bellini‘s librettist - on this opera and Romani understood perfectly Rossini‘s love of pastiche and parody. He provided a commedia dell‘ arte scenario that gave Rossini plenty of opportunity to mock traditions he had helped to cultivate in the first place. The plot is delightfully salcious and among the many jewels in the score, the duet for Geronio and Selim, in which the Turk tries to persuade the ageing husband to sell his wife to him, is widely considered one of the composer‘s masterpieces."

All while exploring the boundaries of Norse Mythology and Rune-lore, Psychology and History.  We have recruited both an extension to the line-up with the young and talented Bergen prog rock band Shaman Elephant. We have worked together with some of the most talented moviemakers and visual wizards around - also young and from Bergen: KolibriMedia. Add the Enslaved live crew to the mix and you have got magick, no less.  We have aspired to create a concert film that reflects this expanded representation of ENSLAVED and cannot wait to show you all. It is bigger than any project we have done before, and it is unlike anything else you have seen in this kind of music."

Spectacular views of the Storehogen Mountain in VREID’s hometown of Sogndal, Norway and of Hellisheiði in SÓLSTAFIR’s native Iceland lay the majestic backdrop for this one-of-a-kind, 90-minute long digital streaming event.  Speaking about the livestream, SÓLSTAFIR‘s Aðalbjörn Tryggvason says, “playing live music in sideways rain on moss grown lava. They wanted something Icelandic. Doesn’t get any more Icelandic than this.”  VREID songwriter and bass player Jarle Kvåle adds, “SÓLSTAFIR‘s and VREID‘s stories are two parallel stories of the north. In this weird world, our paths have crossed on several occasions and this time they have merged into something new. This is the third streaming event VREID has done, and in many ways, it represents the end of a trilogy for us"

Candid interviews and archival images combine with the music of many virtuoso performers, from legendary Fred Punahou and Gabby Pahinui to Raymond Kane and today\"s Ledward Kaapana, to tell the slack key story from the 1830s to the present. It shows how this music perpetuates family tradition as songs, techniques and special string tunings are passed from one generation to the next."

Unbeknown to him, Hui is actually the fiancée of his nephew (Sima Wah-lung), to whom he has refused to lend money. Scenes in which Hui plays pranks on him and tricks him into providing funds for her are spiced up by the lively acting of Sun Ma as a wife-fearing perv and Tang as a sassy girl with a sharp tongue. The film ends with Wong making excuses to meet Hui at a hotel but getting caught by his feisty wife. Whilst both are acclaimed comedians in their own right, brassy Tam and composed Tang together pull Sun Ma s leg in an unmissable classic slapstick."

    "description": "Alessandro (HWV 21), is an opera composed by George Frideric Handel in 1726 for the Royal Academy of Music. Paolo Rolli s libretto is based on the story of Ortensio Mauro s La superbia d Alessandro. This was the first time the famous singers Faustina Bordoni and Francesca Cuzzoni appeared together in one of Handel s operas. The original cast also included Francesco Bernardi who was known as Senesino.  The story recounts Alexander the Great s journey to India and depicts him less in a heroic vein than as vainglorious as well as indecisive in matters of the heart. The work s charm and lightness of touch make it at times almost a comic work.[3]"

While most films at the time usually depict how grassroots people rise above adversity, this one tells the story of a famed actress who thrives for success and never gives up on her artistic ambition. This reflects that women s liberation and employment was a dominating theme in left-wing movies. The finale was shot in Eastman colour negative film, which was rare before mid-60s given the limited technical resources in Hong Kong film industry, and thus a valuable record in the city s cinematic history."

Speeding away on a motorcycle, he brings the fighter back to his homeland in Romove, a holy Baltic site. There is about to be a wedding, but the preparations are interrupted by ravens. Their black feathers are a mirror for Daumants’ conscience and act as a reminder of his crime against Jargala, a girl he raped and killed. Soon Daumants falls in battle, and being a stranger in Romove, Baņuta is caught up in sacrificial rituals and revenge. However, she is strong-willed and will not bow to fate – no one will take her happiness away.  A hundred years after the premiere of Alfrēds Kalniņš’ first Latvian opera Baņuta in 1920, comes the opera film Baņuta – an international project that melds opera, musical performances, the conditionality of the performing arts and contemporary performativity."

Modern nostalgia often draws on corporate American-90s mall culture, but what about British culture? With I’ve Been Trying To Tell You – made to accompany the Saint Etienne album of the same name – director Alasdair McLellan evokes the era through the fog of memory. The resulting film, shot in locations from Grangemouth to Portmeirion to Southampton, is both beautiful and enveloping."

Sit s role may be small but with radiance from her glorious smile and beaming personality, she brightens up this musical romantic comedy like a fairy-tale nymph."

His life also offers a commentary on the change that art in India has witnessed with the decline of the riyasats (kingdoms) and the patronage they offered. Lastly, the film attempts to draw one towards our ancient  guru shishya parampara , as preserved and practised by one its most revered exponents."

The work was created in response to the censorship of Verdi’s 1849 Stiffelio, whose tale of a protestant pastor publicly pardonning an adulterer and his wife proved too scandalous for 19th-century Italian society. In creating Aroldo, Verdi’s librettist and collaborator Francesco Maria Piave transposed Stiffelio’s story and characters to the more distant setting of Great Britain at time of the Crusades, and the composer took advantage of this new version to add a fourth act to the opera, and to rewrite part of the first act as well as a few arias."

Cullum mixes Jazz with melodic Pop and Rock into a crossover style that calls to mind such artists as Harry Connick, Jr., and Norah Jones. In that vein, Cullum will just as often cover a swinging Jazz standard as a modern Rock song, and his original compositions deftly move from earnest ballads to songs of sardonic wit."

The plutonium powered device was stashed on the mountain with the intention of recovering it the following season, however it has yet to be found, and \"could still be ticking somewhere\". Since 1965, the plutonium-powered generator has potentially been leaking radioactivity into the mountain. Mysterious cases of cancer abound in the surrounding villages, and the mountain has since been closed to subsequent expeditions."

Breakbeat, digital hardcore, and gabber all made strong efforts in the race for the bottom, but none of them holds a candle to Donk.  Combining the 150bpm madness of happy hardcore with indecipherable North English rap and then overlaying the whole mess with a single, infuriating \"donk\" sound, Donk may well be the apotheosis of all ridiculous dance music to date. It is also the only local thing going for an entire population of working-class kids with dwindling outside prospects.  We meet up with Black Out Crew, commonly referred to as the Beatles of the Donk scene. Their video \"Put a Donk On It!\" has almost 4 million views on YouTube. So come along for some ecstasy fueled all nighters into the bizarre scene that is Donk."

Her first compositions took place at her parents  house, in the classes she shared with the composer Enrique Cabrera, or on the shores of the ocean when she spent the summer in Costa Azul, her usual beach town. Today, she lives in Montevideo, she listens to her songs and wonders: what is the origin of all these melodies? This film is her desire to relive that music that made her grow. A tribute to the music of her department through the reinterpretation of five songs that marked her songbook. With that map in mind, Florencia goes out in search of answers in conversations with authors, interpreters or actors from the Rochense scene who were witnesses or protagonists of the construction of the local folk. A journey through the essence of a department that traces a route between melodies and landscapes, poetry and culture, and voices and roots."

Moni s StageOrchestra is inspired by that music, by its constant change of tones and by the spirit which pervades it, from the sorrowful, monochord which revives the spirit of a synagogue prayer to the explosive joy of songs and dance music created for happier occasions. It is not a faithful reprise of klezmer music or a philological revisitation we propose here, but rather a free use, which maintains the climate and the imprint of several centuries of musical practice, born and developed in close proximity with the Polish, Czech and Byelorussian civilizations and enriched by a fertile exchange with the musical culture of that other diasporic population of Europe, the Gypsy people."

Even with the cards stacked against him, he stayed true to the Christian values instilled by his loving mother. Little did he know how a random act of kindness would change the course of his life forever. In one unexpected moment, Aladdin found himself face to face with the woman of his dreams. Too bad she was completely out of his league. Comedy and musical numbers ensue as their paths continue to cross. It is said that there is NO GREATER gift than love, but can their love survive the test? Be careful. Things are not always the way they seem."

Her remaining shows were cancelled and no longer able to perform, she went back to living at home with her parents in London. She began to grieve for the year she had lost, sometimes not leaving the house for days. Until, she decided she needed to change her perspective.  Determined not to be defeated by the circumstances, Arlo Parks put a plan together and began writing her debut album, connecting with other artists and fans online and as restrictions began to ease, she flourished even further. She collaborated with some of her favourite singers and performed in two Live Lounges in lockdown. She crafted album artwork and even went to sing on a stripped back Pyramid Stage in Glastonbury.  If there is anyone who has made the most of out lockdown, it is sure to be Arlo Parks."

This frank and very personal depiction of a remarkable forty-year career, fuelled by his  angels and demons , is illustrated with behind-the-scenes footage uncovered for the first time, interviews with former members of the band, producers and musicians, and many performances from the early 70s that depict his unmistakable guitar style."

Flickering, nearly rectangular patterns join on the image plane, at first in black-and-white, bringing to mind the sprocket holes in celluloid film and, not least due to the lack of geometric precision, giving the impression of a pre-digital origin. As the soundtrack rattles on in a minimalistic way, the pattern’s twitchy dance is submerged in various warm hues such as yellow, pink, light green and light blue, which in a different rhythm and to a more agreeable music could be perceived as the signature of slightly retro psychedelia."

This is not a documentary about just music, it s a documentary about the communities that surround the music and embrace it as a way of identification and brotherhood. But this documentary doesn t just ask questions about the culture, it asks questions about how it s possible to maintain a culture that is, at it s core, so opposite of the modern economic and social system."

This project bloomed during an art residency in Iceland, sparked by conversations around our shared philosophies on voice and emotional connection. The nature of Iceland inspired us to make the connection on how the landscape reflects the emotional states of creativity and how it helps manage the homeostasis of our inner emotional landscapes. This exchange between emotion and the landscape opens a space for healing. Creativity provides us with the tools to access a garden of our authentic being, nourishing and balancing us. Allowing ourselves to explore the spectrum of our emotions through the lens of our relationship with the Earth invites others to do the same. The creative process can affect our well being and is a key to human evolution."

Although this audiovisual piece shows the development of a scene rather oriented towards experimentation in terms of electronic genres from different angles; And of course there are countless other artists to stand out in the Buenos Aires musical scene, \"Buenos Aires Ciudad Sonora\" is a valuable approach to the Buenos Aires art scene, fully recommended for those who are curious about how an independent scene is built and what have to say those who dedicate themselves to it on a daily basis."

Dressed in animal costumes, two people in an empty theatre switch between the roles of illness and patient, actor and audience, wolf and butterfly. The animals are associated with the illness, which the director has: lupus means wolf in Latin, whilst patients often have a  butterfly rash.  With blue medical curtains paired with red velvet stage curtains, it echoes the uncomfortable feeling of being on show when in hospital."

This is exactly the feeling that the live recording captures: \"It is an evening that lets everyone feel for a few hours exactly what only music can convey: to feel like we belong together and be carried away from everyday life and all worries. An evening in which, especially in 2020, it was clear what an important task culture fulfills and what an indescribable gap it leaves behind if it is not allowed to take place. The setlist is more than special: current songs cavort next to unforgotten and rarely performed live rarities together with some Accept classics."

From the hymnic « You & I » and « Voodoo Chains » to more complex « Fortune’s Gate » or raging « Unleash The Furies », Furies distils a real Heavy Metal method in 10 lessons. No need to reinvent the wheel to make it roll far, fast and right : if the Parisian four-piece cannot deny old school heavy metal masters’s influence (Judas Priest, Iron Maiden), they add a touch of undeniable freshness and a resolutely contemporary production, coming from prestigious Labomatic (Paris) and Domination (Italy) studios."

    "description": "Stepping is a dance form that can be found across the country at virtually every college with a substantial African American enrollment. Stepping is performed informally during parties as well as more formally during organized step shows. This film explores this tradition, its historical roots as well as its contemporary forms, styles and uses, to understand how students construct various levels of identity through this dance form…African American identity, fraternity or sorority identity, gendered identity and personal identity. The film goes behind the scenes with the Alpha Phi Alphas as they prepare for a step show that is only a few hours away. Cutting between this show and interviews with current and past steppers as well as footage from previous shows, the film provides a broad picture of this vibrant and dynamic dance form."

Against a backdrop of economic decline, art students Martyn Ware and Ian Craig Marsh experimented with early synthesisers to create sounds which would inspire a new generation of pop music with their first band The Human League. When this fractured, Ian and Martyn recruited singer and old friend Glenn Gregory to form Heaven 17. Penthouse and Pavement, their first album, was released in 1980 and was a landmark in UK pop history, combining electronica with pop hooks."

For the exhibition, Lek made a physical version of Temple, the karaoke club originally featured in his feature-length CGI film ‘AIDOL’ (2019), where the fading popstar Diva plans her comeback with an AI ghostwriter. The soundtrack filled the neon-lit room, while screens displayed video game walkthroughs of a new subterranean tunnel that leads virtual ravers from Temple Tube Station to Diva’s club, through the burning rubbish bins of a future-wracked London. Referencing the Japanese meaning of kara-oke⁠—‘empty orchestra’⁠—Temple is a nightclub after the party ends; a place devoid of humans; a sonic architecture filled only with ghosts."

Now, at the age of 84, Yusef Lateef lives withdrawn in his house in the woods somewhere in New England – in a room full of musical instruments. He still plays his saxophone today, as he has done for most of his life. (Humbert & Penzel)"

They called it the “rotten fruit of degraded capitalism, demoralizing the minds of Soviet youth”. Despite that, rock music broke the wall – made a hole in the Iron Curtain – and gained the hearts and minds of tens of thousands of young people.Rock musicians were on the frontline of the rebellion against the Soviet regime. Despite censorship, they managed to deliver, in a hidden, roundabout way through lyrics and music, the spirit of nonconformity and freedom of choice to their audience. A film about Latvian and Soviet rock pioneers, their lives and destinies."

From the band: \"It was a remarkable concert. During the \"Love, Fear and the Time Machine Tour 2015\", the band were in excellent shape, and although we were promoting our more \"song-oriented side\", we played such compositions as \"Hyperactive\" or \"Egoist Hedonist\". On top of that, there is a 20-minute version of \"Escalator Shrine\" and a special, unique version of \"The Same River\" with a modified intro.

They dropped 23,000 tonnes of bombs on the fascists. ‘Be proud, you are a woman.’” Weaving a gothic-fantasy of the all-female Soviet WW2 bomber pilots the ‘Night Witches’, Membering the Night Witches presents an auto-baptism and auto-fertilisation calling for urgent antifascist liberation from our toxic selves.

Drew uses the film to explore his preoccupation with the power of improvisation, how melodies can betray the messages of the cosmos, how music can be telling. Text is significant throughout, taking others’ often historic words and using them to embody our fears, “they long believed that the moon moved, followed them, or often ran this and that toward or away from it”."

She’s done a holiday tour for the past three years, and it didn’t feel right to break that tradition — especially during a year in need of cheer. An in-person tour was off the table, but she also wasn’t interested in doing a livestream performance — “there’s no way you can really capture a live show and make it feel live and vibrant on the screen,” she said.  Instead, the violinist decided to create somewhat of an extended, glorified music video with elaborate set pieces and costumes — elements that wouldn’t work in a live show because they’d take too long to remove or load on and off a truck each night. Doing this show on a budget, Stirling clocked 16-hour days for two months as creative director, designing the sets, sourcing the costumes and helping develop the choreography (including a performance where she hangs by her hair)."

Backed by the Lester Young-influenced alto saxophonist Paul Desmond, bassist Eugene Wright and drummer Joe Morello, Brubeck and his combo perform some of their odd-metered hits. Desmond s dancing ditty, \"Take Five\" is rendered in a faster tempo than the studio version. Brubeck s ragtime-flavoured \"(It s a) Raggy Waltz,\" highlights his percussive piano lines, while \"Castillian Blues\" and the Turkish strains of \"Blue Rondo a la Turk\" reveal his multicultural, compositional genius. Gleason, the show s creator and host, was a well-respected, San Francisco-based jazz critic and author. He remarks during the show that Dave Brubeck was \"a provocative, experimental, and interesting musician.\" That statement is still true today."

This self-defined family is assuaged and even inspired by the ghosts who inhabit this home and begin to see their squatting as a matter of destiny and resistance rather than urgent fear.  Combining spoken word, contemporary movement, video projection, classical, R&B and jazz singing, and a brooding, often joyful score filled with place, purpose, and possibility, We Shall Not Be Moved is a timely exploration of past and present struggles which suggests an alternate future through the eyes of its young protagonists."

Beginning at a time when hardcore music strayed from its punk roots, BANE musically and lyrically challenged people. Five individuals set a course to live and play music by their own rules. After two decades attracting fans with their honesty as people and musicians, the pressure of home life and self-doubt became unavoidable. BANE made an all-or-nothing decision to end the band with a final album and tour. Holding These Moments examines the challenges of living and creating art on your own terms. It explores the artist’s struggle: questioning relevance and living a life of meaning amidst one’s art. Through extensive band, fan, and friend interviews, we see firsthand the impact of people living less ordinarily."

The sisters may not have founded the band, but they quickly became its public face, and Ann s smoking vocals defined its sound, even as its musical format shifted with changing times. Their performing style and their song-writing talents provided definitive proof, as Janis Joplin had before them and Chrissie Hynde would shortly join them in doing, that a woman could rock as hard, as dirty and as unreservedly as any man. They sang about losing their virginity, having one-night stands and raising children on their own without apology, and Ann s tough delivery brought to the lyrics a distinctive mixture of relish and regret that made the songs memorably ambivalent. But they could also write delicate ballads, which Nancy often sang. One of their biggest hits remains 1978 s gentle duet, \"Dog and Butterfly\"."

Filmmaker David Bernabo takes a deep dive on the recently reissued Out of the Blue and the long lost Trust In Rock concert, on the long-gestating audio storyboard The Driver’s Son, and Robert Ashley’s Perfect Lives. Interwoven with discussions on Tyranny’s music is a conversation about the nature of reissues and how distribution is survival for many aging musicians.  Throughout the documentary, Bay Area filmmaker K. O. Beckman’s films with Tyranny, dating back to the 70s, provide rarely-seen performances and video projects.  The film features conversations with Tyranny, composer/musicians Joan La Barbara, Peter Gordon, Kyle Gann, David Grubbs, Philip Perkins, Jeff Berman, and Bill Ruyle, writer Nicole Gagne, artist Pat Oleszko, and Unseen Worlds owner Tommy McCutchon."

This spiritual and often dark corner attempts to hold a mirror in front of you as a visitor and confront you, in order for you to open your eyes and add an extra layer to the event.  Because of the presence of just one area with one stage, each and every visitor is submerged in the same story, that you all take home with you afterwards.

Frankly, that sets the tone for the rest of the set with each track full of wonderful melodies as well as intricate playing and arrangements. ‘The Man Behind the Curtain’ is given an additional edge in the guitar department by one of its co-writers, Stan Ausmus, joining the band. Unlike his usual European set up Ryo Okumoto looks like a wonderful throwback to Rick Wakeman, surrounded by keyboards including two mini Moogs and a real Mellotron. His ‘Kamikaze’ and solo tracks utilise them all too great effect"

Like M*A*S*H—the long-running American TV show (1972–83) it parodies—the work directs attention to the overlooked life in the staging grounds. Showcasing the agonizing choices faced by those who staff the tented encampments of war, it perhaps also serves as a reminder that our neighborhoods remain a warfront too.

    "description": "No Revenge Necessary is a story about humans surviving in an environmentally scarred future. The story contains a surprise that awakens us to the quality and beauty that we as humans possess.  The setting takes place in a future where conditions on Earth have become dire. World leaders rely on Artificial Intelligence (AI) to calculate what the best means for human survival are, which has resulted in AI creating a colony in outer space. Humans are faced with a choice, and many choose to leave, departing in a massive spaceship to a new home. The humans who elected to stay—in a sense, to be sacrificed—are told by the AI that they are actually the ones who will save Earth, as they possess the character and inner strength required to do so – a surprising revelation.  To cope with and survive the poisonous atmosphere, these remaining humans elect to become hybrids. These hybrids must also contend with two Earthlings who refuse to change their biology, thus living in isolation."

The Notwist and the Andromeda Mega Express Orchestra ignore genre boundaries as they hop from style to style, channeling their way through polymorphic soundscapes, wild and beautiful. From the recording of Notwist’s “The Devil, You + Me” album, via collective rehearsals in Berlin, to concerts in Hamburg, Amsterdam and Munich: these kindred spirits always try to improve, try to refine the patterns and arrangements. It seems as if the musicians main concern is to keep the songs in constant motion – Music Not Music."

The music is produced by indie rock icon Cris Eckman (The Walkabouts), and expertly mixed with archive footage of Jezek s own performances and skits, creating a touching and thought-provoking narrative."

There’s a lot of great footage with writer/performers Pleasant Gehman and Iris Berry, torpedoing the influx into the music scene of neophyte phonies who just didn’t get it, explaining title of the program. (After this first aired in 1985, a bunch of the new waver/Durannie chicks at my high school—which is to say all the girls who were trying their suburban Ohio best to look like Gehman and Berry—started calling everyone “poseurs,” which was pretty funny.) There’s also a hilarious interview with employees at a store called “Poseur,” which sold punk fashions and accessories—people had to get that shit somewhere before Hot Topic forever banished punk to the mall, no?

Satterwhite traces these objects and incorporates them into a virtual world filled with family videos and recordings of the artist dancing and vogue-ing in bright, tight body suits.  There are limits with what you can do with objects, because objects are imbedded with history, politics and all kinds of anxiety,  he has said.  To put myself in a virtual world is a political gesture, negating all those associations.  Satterwhite’s worlds evoke the escapism of Afro-futurism and suggest a posthuman quasiutopic virtual reality.\""

With no dialogue, the film is backed by a musical excerpt from Aida whose lyrics express the difficulties of being loyal to one’s country and cultural identity. The personal and urban transformation tackles on issues of identity, loss and disorientation as a result of historical colonialism and contemporary globalization."

Occasionally reaching up to tweak the amplifier or manipulate the guitar pedal to produce screeching and howling feedback, Parrino uses the instruments unconventionally so that together they project a discordant noise. The artist masterfully draws the listener in to hear repetitions, subtle variations, and musical gestures in the unusual sonic palette. Shot by a lone cameraperson, the visuals of Parrino s performance become increasingly abstract as the music develops into a more familiar and alluring language."

This electrifying solo performance kicks off with Skyline Pigeon (taken from  Empty Sky ) before ending with a riotous version of  Saturday Night s Alright (For Fighting) . The setlist rips through classic after classic, including  Rocket Man,   Daniel and  Bennie and the Jets.  It was also the first time Elton performed  Don t Go Breaking My Heart  solo. Climbing on his piano and stomping his way through this virtuoso performance, Elton leaves every ounce of himself on the stage, in a classic concert that was to be the last time he would perform a full show for another 7 months."

By contrasting the creative paths of these artists, and a connection between them by the world renowned Kronos Quartet, the film explores music not as a form of entertainment, career, or even self-expression, but as a tool to develop more deeply meaningful relationships with people and the complexities of the world they live in."

Principally inspired by Washington Irving and Pushkin, Rimsky-Korsakov called on the talents of Vladimir Belsky, an author of other libretti of a fairy-tale, legendary nature and an expert on Russian folk literature. The composer, a genius at orchestration, has given us sparkling music, with oriental touches, that creates fully rounded characters. This is the perfect occasion for Alain Altinoglu to direct his first opera in his new role as Music Director of La Monnaie. After the success of his Don Quichotte and Cendrillon, Laurent Pelly returns to La Monnaie to stage this exuberant political satire, an adventure in unrestrained rhythm. More than a century has passed since its first performance, yet the opera has lost none of its boisterous sarcasm."

Ted Dwane - up there with Este Haim in the bass-face stakes (double bass-face?) - is having the time of his life, and it’s almost like third album ‘Wilder Mind’ never happened.

Through uncommonly intense live shows, elaborate art work and collaborations with a broad spectre of artists from a slew of disciplines, the band created a completely unique universe of their own, which reaches much further than just the musical side.⁠  ⁠  Photographer and videographer Bobby Cochran (°1972 California, USA) started following Amenra a few years ago on various tours of Europe, the United States and Japan. The result is an intimate portrait in which the band members and their closest collaborators reflect upon the past twenty years over stunning images and soul soothing music."

As time runs out, a monolith approaches from outer space, carrying within it a puzzle which they fail to understand. Is it a warning, or does it contain the secret to the survival of mankind?"

The album Remote Galaxy is a journey in time and space, a journey given meaning by the album s music and philosophy. The music is uncompromisingly honest, with a genuine power of its own. Using well-known acoustic technology, the composer takes us to some unusual and, for most of us, unknown places."

The work is not a passion in the traditional sense, since it does not end with Christ s death. Out of Darkness continues through the kingdom of death and out of the grave, leaving us with the gospel of love that overcomes and endures everything, a gospel of grace and forgiveness. Life is the light of mankind, and we can rise out of the darkness."

In words and music each track has a story to tell about man and his relationship with nature, his fellow man and to God. The listener is rewarded with an almost visceral experience of the unaccompanied human voice – breathing and pulsing, direct and unfiltered.  The compositions present nature in all its variation, sensitively evoking the different times of the day, both lyrically and musically: Marianne Reidarsdatter Eriksen, Geirr Tveitt, Håkon Berge, Sven Erik Bäck, Alfred Janson, Bo Holten, Torbjørn Dyrud, Harald Gullichsen, Jaakko Mäntyjärvi and Carl Nielsen."

The composers represented here have often chosen to allow their music to evolve in stable structures and remain within static harmonic spaces even when the music becomes expressive and dramatic: Benjamin Britten, Francis Poulenc, Maurice Duruflé, Eric Whitacre, Morten Lauridsen, Martin Ødegaard, Kjell Mørk Karlsen, Anton Bruckner, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Arvo Pärt, Ola Gjeilo, Andrew Smith and Trond Kverno."

The path to fame was indeed uphill for Norway s leading modernist. However, Valen s diffidence was not the only reason for this - another was his chosen musical language, which grew out of the twelve-tone method of composition associated with Arnold Schönberg, Alban Berg and Anton Webern. By writing this sort of music, albeit with his own highly personal stamp, he was asking for trouble in the conservative world of Norwegian music."

Recordings of the original choral versions can be found on Phoenix Chorale s 2012 album, Northern Lights (Chandos Records).  Producer Morten Lindberg suggested recording a few tracks where I would play layers of two or three pianos, which I thought was a great way to really exploit the surround sound potential on a solo album. We moved the piano between each take, eventually constituting a triangle, and the listener is sitting in the middle in a surround system setup.  As a pianist, improvisation is where my heart is. With this recording I wanted to express and share my passion for that art form."

The connection to Chopin is reflected in several ways in Tellefsen s music, both in terms of choice of style and genre and by the fact that the majority of his works are for solo piano."

In each chapter of the Emergence narrative, the focus is on the beauty of the natural laws and processes in operation, with a mixture of real data visualization and animated film. It interprets the deep structures and principles that give rise to the familiar physical universe, such as symmetries, the distribution of the primes, waves, spatial dimensionality, and the action of the physical forces on matter. Later chapters tackle the emergence of biological forms, thought and eventually a darker turn into the structures and systems of human civilization."

    "description": "The two volumes of Bach’s The Well-Temperd Clavier together represent one of Western music’s greatest achievements. Once described as the ‘Old Testament’ of the keyboard repertoire, these two sequences of 24 Preludes and Fugues – one in every key – represent a wealth of musical invention, ingenuity and delight. A supreme technical challenge for any performer, they also offer an astonishing experience for every listener. Eminent Bach specialist Sir András Schiff, whose discography includes Bach’s complete keyboard repertoire, here performs Book I – embarking upon a cycle that he will conclude next year with Book 2."

Lina, a Fado singer with classical training, 2 records on Sony Music and an expert on Amália Rodrigues, selected some of the Diva s Fado Classics and they immediately started to work in studio, a joint project. Raül framed Lina s voice in analog clouds, with brilliant arrangements and a never-before-tried approach, giving Fado a unique electronic view underlining its universal condition. Lina profoundly moving, each song she owns is a monument in the history of Fado, whose voice haunts us all. Sometimes you need to break the rules, that is how you end up making history."

Hazy visuals enter the process of creative ideas with such art forms as dancing, drawing, and photography. At an audio standpoint, the score goes through a similar creation by being a recording of a guitar pluck being altered into an atmospheric synth and overlaid with field recordings of art making. The piece takes into account the various ideas and thoughts that go into artistry, and lead the viewer from the traditional aspects of preparation and through to the breaking of tradition to create something unique and personal to the artist."

Rusalka, a lyrical fairy tale inspired by The Little Mermaid and Undine, is Dvořák’s penultimate work and one of his greatest successes. In Opera Ballet Vlaanderen’s production, Norwegian director and choreographer Alan Lucien Øyen adds a new dimension to this masterpiece of the Czech repertoire by representing the main characters on stage twice: by a singer and a dancer. This doubling reinforces the opera’s deeply dreamlike nature. The impressive South African soprano Pumeza Matshikiza embodies the character of Rusalka, while the Lithuanian conductor Giedré Šlekytė leads the orchestra with brio and intensity."

The footage from the big screen on your big screen, and top-quality studio versions of the concert arrangements to blast through your speakers. It s not a livestream of the concert. The essence of the concert is the huge sound from a big orchestra and the hypnotic footage on the big screen.

    "description": "Karl Richter breathed new life into Bach s music by bringing it to  new circles of listeners. The church musician Karl Richter (1926-1981)  founded the Munich Bach Orchestra and Bach Choir in the 1950s and thus put  into practice his new ideas of Bach interpretation. He departed from  oppressively large orchestral arrangements, introduced a new simplicity,  allowing the notes to turn directly into music. He kindled a blaze of  enthusiasm for Bach that goes on to this day. \"The Legacy of Karl Richter\"  documents the main milestones, events and people in the life of this great  artist and personality. It shows his roots in the Saxon-Thuringian musical  tradition and conveys something of the splendor of Karl Richter s  interpretations of Bach and Handel, which remain unsurpassed to this day.  Light is also shed upon the versatility of Richter s musical talent, which  ranged far beyond Bach and Handel."

    "duration": "2h 54m",
    "genre": "Music",
    "description": "At first glance, the title of Shostakovich’s opera seems to speak for itself: Katherina, neglected and unhappy in her marriage, commits the most heinous crime just like the Shakespearian Lady Macbeth. But Nikolai Leskov’s short novel, which portrays Katherina as a monster, was only the starting point for Shostakovich to elicit understanding for an oppressed woman whose pursuit for self-determination is suppressed by society. Through combining satiric, grotesque and tragic elements in his music, Shostakovich succeeds in striking the balance between repulsion at Katherina’s immoral acts and sympathy for her. Violence, eroticism and the paralysing boredom of Russian society in the 19th century are the founding elements of this composition. The choir and orchestra of the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino conducted by James Conlon accompany tremendous soloists such as Jeanne-Michèle Charbonnet, Vladimir Vaneev and Vsevolod Grivnov in the original language in this live recording."

In this case Bach wrote them for his young wife, Anna Magdalena. The over-riding impression left by these suites is one of endearing tunefulness. Clavier-Übung II is a later collection of didactic keyboard pieces. It comprises two greatly contrasted works: the Italian Concerto and the Overture in the French Style. These performances admirably demonstrate the thoughtful and persuasive approach that András Schiff adopts when performing Bach.

For conductor Roberto Abbado, the transposition of the action to the present day releases the energy of Rossini s music. At his disposal is a cast of top-quality vocalists such as the “refined bel canto artist(Bresciaoggi) Sonia Ganassi as Elcia, and the “outstanding” Dmitry Korchak as the Pharaoh s son, two lovers fatefully drawn into the political turmoil and catastrophes of their time. Also among the protagonists are the “thoroughly brilliant” (DeutschlandRadio Kultur) baritone Alex Esposito as Faraone and, in his Rossini Festival debut, young, full-bodied bass Riccardo Zanellato as Moses. Conductor Roberto Abbado “inspired his musicians to deliver a spectacular performance” (Salzburger Nachrichten)."

    "description": "This new Dynamic opera was performed in Donizetti s native city of Bergamo, during the most important world festival dedicated to the Italian composer. The opera is set in a rural environment and the action takes place in a country farm. It is a brilliant comedy with many points of contact with semi-serious operas. The choice of this subject must have been strongly influenced by the successes of Vincenzo Bellini s La Sonnambula.  The music is folksy and the melodic writing frank and straightforward with a broad variety of passages of high technical content and more elegiac in character; such is the case of the most famous piece in the whole opera, the aria \"Una furtiva lagrima\", which is also the leitmotiv of the soundtrack of the 2005 film Match Point, directed by Woody Allen."

    "description": "The soldier Wozzeck (Christian Gerhaher) flits through a world that he is unable to decipher. The doctor torments him with absurd medical experiments; the captain humiliates and ridicules him. And Wozzeck’s lover, Marie (Gun-Brit Barkmin), with whom he has a child, cuckolds him with the drum major. Wozzeck becomes a murderer, stabbing Marie to death. Georg Büchner’s drama fragment, on which Alban Berg based his first opera, is an unflinching case study of social injustice and human suffering. But it is also a grotesque piece that thrives on exaggeration – and in which only a fine line separates the unfathomable from the ridiculous. Accordingly, director Andreas Homoki forgoes all realism."

In Germany, in the late 1920s and early 1930s, Weill had already begun to use American jazz and popular song elements in his operas. After fleeing from Germany in 1933, he worked in Paris, then England, and then, beginning in 1935, in New York. Weill made a study of American popular and stage music and worked to further adapt his music to new American styles in his writing for Broadway, film and radio. He strove to find a new way of creating an American opera that would be both commercially and artistically successful."

It is a film about how a small house in a back yard in Hasseris outside Aalborg came to be the epicentre of Danish rock music. The film tells the story of how founder Jørgen Bornefeldt created a unique space where inspiration and music could flow freely. Spectator Records was the hotbed of Danish rock music and we have never looked back since. It was a honey pot of bubbling and sizzling creativity, which unfortunately went up in smoke. For many years, no one knew what happened – and conspiracy theories about why the studio burned, lived merrily among its aficionados – but now we know. The story of  Spectator Records – Up in Smoke  is the original hippie history that has never been told. About an explosive release of wild energy that forever changed the music and the people who came near Jørgen and Spectator Records."

The opera debuted on 3 November 1810 at the Teatro San Moisè in Venice  Composed in a few days when he was 18 years old, La cambiale di matrimonio was Rossini s first professional opera. The overture, written when he was a student at the Liceo Musicale in Bologna, is an important part of the modern concert repertoire.

    "description": "A documentary film about Pulitzer prize-winning composer David Del Tredici and the historical and cultural significance of his music within and outside the gay community. The film investigates the sometimes ineffable processes that are fundamental to music composition, performance, and the communication of meaning through art. Highlighting the nuanced challenges of private sexual identity projected outward into art, the film examines Del Tredici’s personal transformations through the joys and sorrows of gay life, and his goal of communicating sexuality through music that is influential in modern culture. Through performances of Del Tredici s atonal and neo-Romantic music and interviews with world-renowned musicians and scholars, the film explores what sexuality in music represents creatively and what the implications of identifying an art form as gay, as Del Tredici has done, may be."

    "description": "When the Stray Cats rolled into Montreux in July of 1981 they were one of the hottest properties around. They had 3 hit singles and a UK top 10 album already under their belts along with a string of headlining concerts, all of which had come since their relocation from New York to London in 1980. The band s combination of original songs and rockabilly classics with a punk attitude and style had caught the moment to perfection. Added to this were their considerable musical accomplishments and knack for songwriting. All in all it was a heady concoction and the crowd in Montreux reacted with near hysterical excitement, something rarely seen in what is usually a polite and reserved audience. This is the Stray Cats at their peak."

From within a cage-like structure filled with traditional musical instruments and sound-making devices fashioned from ordinary objects and toys, Kubota creates an aural/visual montage of musical notes and noises. Praised by music educators as a valuable tool for teaching creativity in sound exploration and musical innovation, the film reveals the infinite percussion possibilities of simple objects and presents a portrait of a versatile performer whose imagination has led him far beyond the confines of conventional music.

Shake Dance is a documentary that takes viewers to a number of strip clubs in the Atlanta area, where some of the nation s best shake dancers show off their moves and talk about their jobs; some regard what they do as an art form and a means of personal expression, while others just look at dancing as a fast way to make a buck.

Like Impulsators, those non-camera films came into being as a result of perforation of film stock, which thus lets through in a desired way the light from the projector, which is in turn “fixed” on the retina and produces after-images. The movement of the film stock generates lively flicker targeted directly at the viewer’s body, above their imagination. Immersed in the trance rhythm, the impulsator becomes a new psychophysical force."

God revealed himself directly to Moses, instructing him in absolute truth. Moses was charged with leading the people of Israel to the Promised Land and escaping from Egyptian slavery. Moses came to embody the relationship between the human and divine truth.  God’s call to Moses presented a new idea that exploded all previous religious concepts: ‘One God – unique, eternal, intangible, inconceivable’. Moses understands this concept, but is unable to express it, and therefore God appoints Moses’ brother Aaron as his spokesman. They are bound to fail: Aaron can only approach sharing the idea by compromising its meaning, whilst Moses is left to search fruitlessly for “the word I lack …”\r This production of Arnold Schoenbergs opera was filmed during the Ruhrtriennale 2009."

His is a tale of survival, creativity and reinvention. He is proof that there is always potential for change and even in 2019, more than fifty years after his death, he is challenging Donald Trump from beyond the grave.  With enormous influence on successive generations of musicians like Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Joan Baez and Billy Bragg, this film proves he has a true place in 21st-century culture."

Then there is the beautiful duet she sings with Maximilian Kiener. This is to die for!

In 1976 Wishbone Ash were at the zenith of their career. Their albums, from \"Pilgrimage\" to \"New England\", reached worldwide top positions in the album charts, were refined with silver and gold, the band was constantly on tour around the globe and tracks like \"The King Will Come\", \"Warrior\" or \"Blowing Free\" achieved cult status among fans of guitar-oriented progressive rock and are milestones in rock history. Characteristic of Wishbone Ash is their melodic, guitar-oriented rock, which is dominated by two electric guitars played in duet. In addition there is an almost ballad-like vocal style. This Rockpalast edition is a must for every Wishbone Ash fan!"

A Lot of Sorrow is both a music video and an extended concert film, in which Brooklyn-based band the National performs its three-and-a-half minute ballad “Sorrow” on repeat for six hours. The band’s music and lyrics frequently conjure notions of romantic suffering and melancholy—themes common to Kjartansson’s emotive, theatrical work.  As the hours pass and fatigue sets in, the musicians subtly alter their song; the original track is always recognizable but is also shown to be elastic and expressive rather than rigid. Kjartansson is sometimes visible in the role of roadie, offering water and food to the performers throughout the concert. Multiple camera angles grant the viewer access to both the perspective of the musicians and that of the audience, as the band and the crowd feed off each other’s energy with every repetition."

On occasion he recorded with a small group from his orchestra or as a piano soloist, but Duke was rarely filmed in that capacity... with a few exceptions. On January 23, 1967, Ellington filmed two programs for Danish television. The first has him jamming with an octet taken from his orchestra, including such greats as altoist Johnny Hodges, tenor-saxophonist Paul Gonsalves, baritonist Harry Carney and trumpeter Cat Anderson. Highlights include \"The Jeep Is Jumpin ,\" \"Sophisitcated Lady\" and \"Jam with Sam.\" The second program puts the focus on Ellington s piano, in solo and trio performances that include \"Lotus Blossom,\" \"Mood Indigo,\" and a definitive version of \"Take the  A  Train.\" Always a modern and distinctive soloist, Ellington is seen creating brilliant improvisations full of strong melodies, subtle surprises and sly wit."

The lineup is the most ambitious in years, welcoming blues masters like Bukka White, Sleepy John Estes, Furry Lewis and the 106 year-old Nathan Beauregard, coupled with more notable headliners like Rufus Thomas & The Bar-Kays, John Fahey and rocker Johnny Winter. One attendee that year was Gene Rosenthal, who brought along a couple of cameras, a small crew and left with 40,000 feet of color film that was left untouched for nearly 50 years….until now. ‘Memphis 69’ is a time capsule. If you’re a blues enthusiast, watching this film feels like you’ve opened up a treasure chest and discovered that you’ve hit the motherload."

This project uses the medium of film and aerial dance to distort the audience’s perception of what is physically possible, altering reality and creating an illusionary body/spirit dissociation.  The film creators draw from Limerick s history and culture to influence both the narrative and some of the film’s imagery. The title alludes both to the well-known Irish dance and to stories of the city, from the Vikings and the siege of Limerick (1690) to the current cultural and social realities of Limerick."

The term iso is related to the ison of Byzantine church music and refers to the drone accompanying polyphonic singing. The drone is performed in two ways: among the Tosks, it is always continuous and sung on the syllable  e , using staggered breathing, while among the Labs, the drone is sometimes sung as a rhythmic tone, performed to the text of the song. Rendered mainly by male singers, the music traditionally accompanies a wide range of social events, such as weddings, funerals, harvest feasts, religious celebrations and festivals such as the well-known Albanian folk festival in Gjirokastra."

For Johnny Starke digging through dusty thrift shop bins to find lost wax and forgotten sounds is not simply a hobby... It’s his chief obsession and his life’s work.  This is a film about record collecting and more importantly, it’s about saving forgotten pieces of popular culture and returning them to the turntable, the dance floor and ultimately back to their historical relevance.  Director Anthony Ladesich brings to life the story of one collector, one 45rpm record, and one song."

Particularly rich both on the musical level and in atmosphere, scrutinizing love in far-off lands (Turkey, Peru, Persia and America), it responds to the infatuation with exoticism that tinged all the arts of the century. Rameaus dance music is always quite suggestive, evocative of a movement or a pictorial atmosphere. As for the staging, Laura Scozzi brings her contemporary vision to these countries and travels.  Filmed at the Bordeaux National Opera, this production marked the Rameau celebrations in 2014 and was unanimously hailed by the international press"

A nostalgic invitation to a dancing story about a girl returning to her childhood, when she dressed up as different women using her mother s wardrobe, and all the roles she played were to please herself. This film is a tool for reconstructing the scenes from the youth, as well as a baroque farewell to all the glitter and unicorns. Stabat Mater Dolorosa is like a bayonet slashing through modern times. She gives us micro-performances with all her body, and at her own risk. SIKSA s music is the scenario rejected, grinded, spat out, negated and intensified by the characters. Piotr Macha s camera is one of the murder weapons that SIKSA would like to use to fuck up the modern reality. It s a language of art that SIKSA has been using almost unnoticed since 2014."

Fortunately, the Opèra de Lausanne has no time for such moral grandstanding. This new staging of Così is Jean Liermier’s second production for Lausanne after his My Fair Lady in 2015.

Simply put, this film is just your everyday druggie, dramedy, indie musical that s filled with Germans, Jesus, banjos, bongos, beers, and bongs."

    "genre": "Music",
    "description": "“What is this life—and this death?” Gustav Mahler famously asked when composing his second symphony. Does consciousness “continue” on a higher cosmic level, he wondered, or is it “only an empty dream?” Narrated by renowned baritone Thomas Hampson, this film explores the musical, biographical, and philosophical background of the monumental work. Viewers are treated to beautifully produced historical reenactments as well as interviews with many of the world’s most respected Mahler scholars and biographers, including Henry-Louis de La Grange, Donald Mitchell, Morten Solvik, and others. Philosopher Martha Nussbaum and theologians Catherine Keller and Neil Gillman also add their insights. Woven throughout is a critically acclaimed performance of the symphony featuring members of the New York Philharmonic and the Philadelphia Orchestra under the direction of maestro Neeme Järvi."

But in 2012, the band was put on hold, and its frontman Sasha Chemerov moved to Los Angeles. Musicians got back together in the summer of 2017 and gave a series of powerful shows.  «Dymna Sumish: Between Hell and Heaven» is a movie about the comeback, friendship, and rock’n’roll. The film includes interviews with band members, concert footage from different periods and live performances, specially shot for the movie.  And although the band split up at the beginning of 2018, we believe that its story and legacy still matter."

Thanks to the steadfast persistence, irrepressible energy and at the same time peaceful ideology and a firm backbone, the heavy metal subculture succeeded to overcome the boundaries of the political system, time and space, thus becoming a part of culture and sociopolitical history of the nation. The authors of the film try to immortalize the spirit of this era of Slovenian music through testimonies of the main representatives of Slovenian heavy metal scene from those times, and offer it to future generations. At the same time, they want to pay these incredible musicians and their audience due respect which they rarely got during the time of their musical existence."

    "description": "Jackie McLean is a true jazz master and one of the few true authorities of the bebop era still in business, but at the time of this film his main gig was teaching at Hartford. Hartford seems to have had a low-profile and low-budget jazz department, and the same goes for this film, which clocks in at just over half an hour, and barely scratches the surface of the subject matter. Still, what is here is engaging and a surprisingly candid portrait. McLean is shown practicing in his apartment and - briefly - playing with his quintet, but most of the running time is spent at Hartford in the classroom - and what classes they must have been. McLean s stream-of-consciousness lectures run from Sun Ra to JFK s assassination to how he learned Giant Steps, and the students try their best to keep up. A fascinating glimpse into the mind of a jazz musician."

In doing so, he commits different locations with a personal connection and also lets people from his circle of friends have their say, such as other members of the band project Antinational Embassy, his label mate Herzog and the Anti Turista Squad.

The symptoms are very severe, many cases leading to the death of most trees. As a result, it is assumed that the ash tree in Europe will soon be close to extinct. Choreographer and dancer Dagmar Dachauer was inspired by the sad faith of the European ash tree, and linked it to the personal loss in her own life. Finis est cinis: Ash is what remains. Ash is a eulogy for the ash tree and for Prasthan Dachauer, who passed away in 2016."

Filmed at a series of outstanding performances at the Teatro Real de Madrid in December 2016, this recording will especially delight lovers of Wagnerian music drama with its faithful reflection of the grandiose staging of Alex Olle, a member of La Fura dels Baus, whose earlier productions have attracted widespread attention. A conductor equally at home in Monteverdi, Boulez, Praetorius and Schumann, Pablo Heras-Casado can rely on a cast totally committed to this breathtaking musical hurricane!"

From the moment he takes the stage with Figaro’s iconic aria “Largo al factotum,” Leo Nucci combines winning charm with a robust baritone. Soprano Kathleen Battle tosses off one glittering vocal display after another as the feisty Rosina, while tenor Rowell Blake makes for an ardent Count Almaviva. Ralf Weikert conducts the lively performance, which also includes the comic duo of Enzo Dara as Dr. Bartolo and Ferruccio Furlanetto as Don Basilio."

Faye s English is quite good, as she had studied in the States in her early years. The songs were really a great treat. Maybe she is hinting of things to come for all her fans. Hopefully the Queen of Pop will crossover and do an English cover for her oversea fans. Faye is one of the most creative and experimental female artists in all of Asia.  With over 30 musical songs, Faye mesmerized her audience with her electrifying and passionate performance. You can see her fans at the concert were in awe as they sat silent listening to Faye s amazing voice. She sang many of her top hits including Dream Lover, Sky, Brink of Love and Pain, Cold War, and Date."

    "year": 2018,
    "duration": "2h 31m",
    "genre": "Music",
    "description": "Is this a film about Scrooge? About a composer’s life? An opera within an opera? The Passion of Scrooge blurs these lines between performance, documentary, and fiction, into a cinematic concert experience that’s seasoned with magical reality. Composer Jon Deak has adapted Charles Dickens’ timeless tale into a contemporary opera that melts the heart, but doesn’t avoid the darkness in Scrooge that’s still resonant with the material concerns of our time. Using neither period costumes, nor set pieces to reconstruct old England, the film invites you to experience A Christmas Carol with the imaginative possibilities of a radio play. And then, to meet those visions in your head, filmmaker H. Paul Moon‘s floating camera intimately captures musicians performing the score as characters themselves, in this ageless haunted redemption story about “us, every one.”"

This maestro, a bel canto specialist, captured the fire and intensity of the passions from the get-go, making the overture a superbly eloquent transition to a musical world based on beautiful lines and colors that elaborate distress and make it compellingly elegant. Allemandi demonstrated a full authority over the stage for the musically complex scenes, and in the arias and duets he demonstrated his confidence in the artistry of distraught singers by establishing ample tempos to support their soaring vocal lines while he concentrated on pulling every possible nuance from the pit players."

When I was a child, there was a book I always used to read when I went to the hospital. One day as I was reading it as I always did, suddenly the ending had changed. Sometime later, when I read it again, it had returned to normal.  —  In our everyday routine, there are moments when suddenly we feel like something is different; this unexpected change, like in my memory, feels like it has a kind of reality.

Each new section presents a variation on the same sleek, kinetic minimalism. As each section progresses, the razor-sharp line between a host of binary oppositions—black/white, figure/ground, silence/sound, here/there, on/off — dissolves through sheer velocity. The rapid-fire alternation between these binary oppositions acts like the flicker of film frames, accelerating until sound and sight are wed into a synchronous whole in which neither the visual nor the sonic takes primacy. Instead, each acts as mutually constitutive literalisation of the other.  — Joseph Clayton Mills"

    "year": 2007,
    "duration": "1h 45m",
    "genre": "Music",
    "description": "Heartbreak Hotel was not Elvis Presley s first single--songs like That s Alright Mama, Mystery Train and I Forgot To Remember To Forget, his first national chart-topping hit, predated it by a year--but it was destined in many ways to define the Elvis persona and arguably become the first rock  n  roll record. It was a song of teenage angst. Not the puppy love hand-wringing of later songs of the era but the real end-of-the-line, so-lonely-I-could-die variety that in those early days only Elvis and his rebel stance could make ring with authenticity. It established rock  n  roll as an attitude -- brash, rebellious and sexually- charged -- as much as a musical style and gave it life as the soundtrack for alienated youth even during American boom times in the  50s. John Lennon once commented that if there had been no Elvis, there would have been no Beatles."

Over the course of these three marvelous videos (totaling about 160 minutes and over 40 songs, including repeats), we are nearly overwhelmed by the charm, charisma, and sheer talent that made Elvis Presley so extraordinarily popular and influential. There are songs from television shows (emphasizing the mid- 50s appearances that helped cement his iconic status), concerts, and movies, along with interviews, some revealing (mostly silent) home movies, and photos galore. And by favoring the music Presley made in his earlier years, as well as by loading the videos with complete, uninterrupted performances, executive producer Andrew Solt and company show us how Presley combined country, gospel, and R&B to make rock & roll the most vital pop culture phenomenon of the past 50 years. This is the mother lode, and a must-have for longtime adherents and newcomers alike."

Presley returned on Oct. 28, 1956, continuing to provoke ecstatic screams with hits such as \"Don t Be Cruel,\" \"Love Me Tender\" and \"Hound Dog.\" In fact, these exhilarating performances were so explosive that Elvis was filmed above the waist during his final Sullivan show appearance on January 6, 1957."

The minorities express their needs, but their expression seems so powerless and fragile in comparison with the society at large.

He was working with heavy-hitters William Kentridge and Warrick Sony on Faustus in Africa, staged in Grahamstown in 1995.  This is a rollicking musical ride through all these incarnations, with frank insights from 80’s and 90’s musicians and leftie luminaries – from Johannes Kerkorrel to Lloyd Ross, Pieter-Dirk Uys to Zapiro by way of the Radio Rats’ Jonathan Handley and Vusi Mahlasela.  It’s an intimate portrait of a wildly talented poet painted by those who knew him best."
