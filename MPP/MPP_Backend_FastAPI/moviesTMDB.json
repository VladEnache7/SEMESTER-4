This concept came to me when I read an article in Wired magazine about the possible outcomes of hacking a robot while its building a car, or cleaning your home or more terrifyingly, in the middle of an operation on a human patient.

A hacker would be hired for a ‘Botch Job…’ The story was simple, if I had a criminal mind and I was a bit lazy what would I do with a team of robots at my command… the outcome is limited only by your imagination."

It is now up to Bheem and team to decide who is the real owner of shakti astra and to whom the power source should be handed over as the lives of thousands of inhabitants of Shakti Grah depends on that single decision."

The film s central motif is a stylized, choreographed sparring training that, while aimed at empowerment and self-discovery, can sometimes escalate beyond control. This metaphorical approach isn t about antagonism but represents the passionate debates that fuel progress and understanding, even when they momentarily seem to get out of hand.  \"There is no losing in martial arts. Either you win or you learn.\" - as Karate Kid would say today."

The creativity, modern lyricism and social commitment of the filmmakers before the 1979 revolution is seldom remembered by the film critics outside the country. This film sets out to portray that the post revolution cinema that came to be recognized by the world was a product of Kanoon, an institution that influenced the artistic culture of several generations. Kanoon was a medium for filmmakers to express their socio political and cultural criticisms under the title of children s cinema. It gave rise to an aesthetic art that was itself a by product of that very historical embodiment."

It is also the home of King Trident s sceptre which is used to turn the water into air but you, Black Dog, could use the trident to turn water into gold!  I found this map in one of the many boxes in Harold s Hock Shop. The silly fool doesn t know an expensive item when he sees it. He was going to sell it to me for only ten gold pieces.  Anyway, I had the map in my grasp when that rotten scallywag Galifray took it right from under my nose.  Somehow the  scoundrel managed to trade it for a dragon bracelet. Harold also threw in a magic genie lamp for good luck! I don t know how Galifray does it but he sure has the gift of the gab.  I have managed to persuade Galifray to trade the map for the measly sum of a thousand gold pieces. We will meet you on Black Dragon Isle at the usual time.  Your trusty shipmate,  Sharky"

I went to hike Colorado Trail to find the reasons why do I hike. This was independent project and the movie was filmed, edited and written by myself. It was challenging to carry all of video equipment in my backpack, but I had a vision and a goal – I wanted to capture my inner reasons why I do hike and why do I always go back to long distance hiking. \""

Joining her on the adventure is her faint-hearted best-friend, Khal, who turns out to have a secret that brings with it a world of trouble for the pair. Ahead of them lies a war zone fraught with menacing bandits, lumbering giants and an army bent on capturing them dead or alive. At their heels stalks the nefarious, black-cloaked Mr. Tinker and his band of robot goons. During their odyssey, Trixi and Khal not only evade loathsome foes and overcome hardships but they come to realize important values such as friendship, courage and hope.  —Tyler Gibb"

Obvious question would be why didn t the cameraman warn him? The film tells the story of two explorers, George Breakston and Yorke Coplen, setting out to make a photographic record of animal life, and the lives of the tribes they encounter along the way. It is broken up into three segments---the journey from Nairobi to the Land of the Pgymies; the trip from there to the territory of the Masai tribe; and the Masai tribe itself."

The film begins with old timer, Dinny (some say he knows too much for an outsider) telling the story of the Kelly Gang to a visiting sketch artist. His tale unfolds as Ned Kelly and Joe Byrne surprise the constabulary in the bar of the Glenrowan Hotel and Ned shoots a constable in the hand.  The Glenrowan Affair includes the ambush at Eleven Mile Creek, the hold up at the Jerilderie Bank and the siege at the Glenrowan Hotel where Ned, dressed in a suit of homemade armour, taunts the  traps  in a hail of gunfire before he is shot and captured."

While the original from 1964 starred the great old-time actor Konoe Jushiro, this version is perfectly cast with his son Matsukata Hiroki in the lead as Wadakuro, one of four ronin hired to fight against the Shogunate s plot to abolish the Gamo Clan, who are struggling to reinstate their young heir Tanemaru as their Lord. Facing the threat of the Koga Ninja, Wadakuro shows his own cruelty while on a personal vendetta. This is a very brutal film, with lots of realistic ninja action, violent deaths, a dark story line and is completely without any light-hearted  humor  elements that Toei used to incorperate back in the golden era.

The movie s title summarises the setup, and most of the footage shows firefighters using ladders to rescue stage girls, clad in portions of their costumes, from an upper level. Although it all seems pretty tame by today s standards, it no doubt provided its male viewers with some brief moments of excitement as the various women hurried down the ladders with their costumes in disarray.

Suzuki contrasts tranquil glimpses of traditional regional life with the emergence of the new rock  n  roll youth culture and the greed and seething cynicism of encroaching Westernism.  Also released under the title \"Go To Hell, Hoodlums!\", this is a melodrama as colorful, shocking, and exhilarating as one would come to expect from Japan s master filmmaker."

He has defended his super bantamweight titles eight times and, after taking home The Ring featherweight title at the expense of Barrera, is looking to expand his trophy case by adding the WBA and IBF featherweight titles.  Rather reluctant to part with them is 30-year-old Juan Manuel Márquez. Aside from a highly-controversial split-decision loss in 1999 and a disqualification in his debut, he is unbeaten in more than 40 fights. Of his last 11 opponents, 10 have been stopped before the final bell, the sole survivor losing a technical decision.  Considering that Pacquiao has stopped 12 of his last 13, all but two inside six rounds, that this fight will be absolutely crazy is pretty much a given."

Nathan Fletcher has voices in his head that make him travel the globe and surf to a different tune. In typical Hawaiian style, Dustin Barca had to fight for everyone’s respect and it is undeniable in his surfing. You will see Brent Dorrington, who at 17 has that natural surfing style that echoes a young Tom Curren.

The season saw a wave of emerging talent such as Pedro de la Rosa (Arrows), and notably Jarno Trulli (Jordan), who ran strong at the Nurburgring and Monaco respectively. But no one looked close to challenging the sport’s contemporary stars Michael Schumacher (Ferrari) and Mika Hakkinen (McLaren). With the aid of Ferrari’s master strategist Ross Brawn, Michael Schumacher’s persistence and determination clinched the championship title for the third time. This video captures the season’s most awesome moments, including unique footage previously only seen on the pay-per-view channels which are produced by Formula One Administration Limited."

The movie represents the transition between the game s first and second Sagas and seems to have been made primarily for fans of the card game, so familiarity with the basic story and characters is assumed. Those watching the movie without first reading the background info in the included booklet are going to be totally lost about what s going on, as the movie begins right in the middle of the climatic battle which wraps up the first Saga. Though it uses the same organizations as the Aquarian Age TV series, the movie does not seem to be directly related to the TV series in any way. (I cannot absolutely confirm this, however, since I only ever saw the first few episodes of the TV series.)"

Awang Janggut is very much a pseudo-warrior. Instead of a “keris”, a warrior’s weapon, he owns a prize-winning rooster. His battlefield is the cock fight arena. Home is a big but empty house inherited from his ancestor, and prefers living in poverty to working. The closest he comes to the high life of a warrior is when a rich businessman employs him as a bodyguard after he prevents hooligans from taunting the latter’s daughter Siti. Despite knowing Awang is married, Siti continues to flirt with him, causing him to leave his pregnant wife alone. She eventually falls sick and has a miscarriage. The film is a social criticism of people who rest on their laurels and ancestry instead of working for themselves. It is also one of the finest examples of the anti-hero in Malay cinema."

    "description": "One of the great stories from Japan’s rich history comes to life in this true tale of the bloody showdown between two rival yakuza gangs in the 1840’s. The battle between Boss Sukegoro of Iioka and Boss Shigezo of Sasagawa has been portrayed many times, most notably in the first Zatoichi film, where the blind man befriends the tubercular ronin Hirate Miki, before cutting him down in one of the great duels in cinema history. This all-star extravaganza pulls out all the stops, with appearances by virtually all of the great actors and actresses from Toei’s studio at the time. Ichikawa Utaemon’s portrayal of the kind-hearted, noble yakuza boss Shigezo of Sasagawa contrasts sharply with the devious Sukegoro of Iioka. Corrupt as he may have been, his men were all willing to give up their lives for him."

Following Zarkana s successful run in Moscow, it was announced that the show would start residency at the Aria Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. The show replaced the Cirque du Soleil resident production Viva Elvis, which closed in August 2012 at the Aria Resort.  Zarkana by Cirque du Soleil is about a spirited journey through an abandoned theater where an extraordinary circus comes back to life. Populated by a motley collection of off-the-wall characters and incomparable acrobats, Zarkana is a visual vortex set in a twisted acrobatic fantasy universe where, little by little, chaos and craziness give way to a true celebration."
