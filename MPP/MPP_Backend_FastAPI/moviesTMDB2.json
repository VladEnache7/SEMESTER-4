Throughout the film, \"Lighthouse\" illustrates the emotional journeys and resilience of these women, as well as the active change that Kalangarai strives to achieve.

For some mothers, who don t fit into  society norm,  this has become a day of anxiety, fear and self consciousness.  The Other Mother s Day is a semi-personal film by Thai filmmmaker Duangtawan Sirikoon that acts as an experimental celebration of what an inclusive mother s day would feel like for a group of mothers that have been made to feel like they are  other , outcasts, something their children are acutely aware of. A group of mothers who are: transgender; in a gay couple; in extreme poverty; covered in tattoos.  Motherhood is expressed through the opinions and cheer of both children and mother - leaving us with the abundantly clear message: why on Earth would anyone/ society question the sanctity of these children s relationships with their rightful, loving mothers? And who s really doing the damage to the children s esteem?"

Only one person was killed, a ROTC student, who s death is the oldest cold case in Greensboro, NC history. The documentary gives an in-depth look into the controversial hotbed of racial strife and protests in the late 1960s."

Through a game of hide-and-seek, we will reveal its hidden beauties, showing how this picturesque town responds to a literary critique from a bygone era.  Luigi Pirandello, a renowned Italian playwright and writer, wrote the novella \"Notte\" (Night) after a brief stay as a professor at the Istituto Magistrale Bertrando Spaventa during state exams. In it, he did not describe the Abruzzo village in the best light. This visual journey combines tradition and modernity, art and nature, in an affectionate response to Pirandello s words."

The film explores the machinations of party politics in this rural and staunchly Republican county: hollow to hollow vote-hunting; family squabbles over candidates; patronage promises; speech-making on the courthouse steps; and the up-and-down career of the incumbent county Judge-Executive who sought re-election while under indictment for vote fraud conspiracy"

It can only be their choice after they have seen your work.\" Since 2014, due to health reasons, Hu Jie has not been actively making documentaries. This year, in response to an invitation from the Lung Ying-tai Cultural Foundation, he still provided the film \"A Sidelight of the 1968 Up to the Mountains and Down to the Countryside Movement.\" Over the past three years, he has primarily engaged in printmaking, producing about 70 to 80 pieces, in addition to many small print bookplates."

Aesthetically captivating and conceptually interesting, Dwoskin’s films focus on the nuances of the human face and the complexities of the visual gaze. Through unusual shots and enigmatic close-ups, Dwoskin creates a special form of “telescopic intimacy”, revolving around themes such as longing and desire, closeness and alienation, the subject and the ‘other’."

This 30-minute expository film follows a coalition of journalists who will stop at nothing to report the atrocities that have been inflicted upon their land and people, even if it means facing imprisonment or execution. With a powerful combination of first-hand testimonials and on-the-ground war zone footage, Woyane uncovers the brutal reality of the Tigray genocide and brings to light the lived experiences of millions of civilians who have been caught in the crossfires and, in many cases, systematically targeted."

He talks about his fear of the blank canvas and his taste for antiquity, passed on to him by one of his Latin and Greek teachers. With great modesty, he recalls his appointments to the Picard Academy and the Grande Académie, his claim to fame. The camera also follows him to the opening of his exhibition at the Grand Palais in Paris, attended by Princess Paola. Paul-Henri Spaak, former Belgian Prime Minister and fellow student of Paul Delvaux s at the Athénée de St Gilles, recalls some of his memories and the impression Paul Delvaux left on him: \"He was already a little in his dream, not on the same plane as us\"."

Malcolm Morley In 1984, Malcolm Morley was the first winner of the Tate Gallery’s prestigious award, the Turner Prize, for the year’s major contribution to British art. It came as something of a surprise because he has always been, by his own volition, an outsider who remains aloof from the art world. Since 1957, he has lived a reclusive life in America and harbours ambivalent feelings about his native Britain. Characteristically, he was not there to collect his £10,000 prize. It is impossible to label him as a painter, as he has always avoided association with the schools and styles of contemporary art, though he seems to have pioneered many of them. Art critic Robert Hughes calls him, “the man whose methods have been relentlessly plundered by a generation of artists.” This programme looks at Morley and his work. He talks at length about his art and is seen at work in his New York studio."

Its goal is to bring this beautiful but somewhat forgotten region of Slovakia closer to the public. The film is primarily focused on the phenomenon of the cultural-natural landscape, of which man has been a part for a long time. He gradually reshaped it in his own image until its present form. Thanks to the approach of our ancestors, species-rich communities of flowery meadows and pastures, fields and grazing forests were created here. However, in recent centuries, our society and with it the country has undergone many changes. With the absence of traditional farming, the colorful landscape mosaic and many rare organisms are disappearing. Therefore, the main message of this document is to point out the necessity of restoring forms of management that are close to nature, talking about mosaic mowing, extensive grazing and others."

Born in Dresden in 1932, the year before Hitler came to power, Richter later grew up in communist East Germany, before escaping to the West just before the Wall went up in Berlin. Since then he has produced a large diverse body of work from his blurred photobased paintings to his gigantic abstractions, from his Baader Meinhof pictures to his perceptual installations using sheets of glass. Gerald Fox’s film caught up with the artist at his home in Cologne where he was undergoing a period of quiet reflection and preparation before beginning a new series of paintings."

The program explores a whole raft of techniques, apps, websites and ways of thinking that help us to save for the types of things that make our lives more secure: emergency funds, our kids  education, and ultimately our comfortable retirements. A mix of fascinating theory and practical takeaways, Thinking Money is designed to decrease the stress and increase the bandwidth in not just our finance, but our whole lives."

Looking back on Schwitters’ life and work, this film unravels a bizarre story of deceit, intrigue, power and money."

In 1930 this eccentric artist and author and his wife Tanya fled civilization in pursuit of a simple back-to-nature lifestyle.  For seventeen years, they lived on a remote waterless mountaintop in the California desert and raised three children.  Marshal’s monthly articles and Tanya’s poetry in Desert Magazine chronicled life in their arid paradise for a growing national audience.  The family survived the Great Depression and World War II, but isolation and betrayal eventually took their toll."

Their story is not only a story of love or joint creation. This is a story of connection and mutual support. The two of them gave up their regular jobs and income to pursue their dreams together. They are young and light, a new generation of young entrepreneurs. They do not build big plans and business with a million turnover, postponing life for later. Aset and Indira inspire to live here and now and be real."

There are more secrets to reveal where the mountains disappear into the depths of Lake Königssee, a lake that holds a stark resemblance to a fjord at the coasts of the Atlantic ocean. Underwater, fossil marine creatures in limestone rock tell of an ancient seabed, buried deep then heaved skywards by battling tectonic plates. Deep grooves and gouges in the rock were left by an ice age glacier, more than one kilometer thick as it chiseled its way down the valley. Though the ice age ended 12,000 years ago, the mountains still carry echoes of that frozen past. \"Echoes of the Ice Age\" is a portrait of the wildlife in this breathtaking scenery of the Berchtesgaden Alps."

The Unseen Crisis is a feature-length documentary that provides an intimate, uncensored look into the lives of those who live with the debilitating after-effects of the COVID-19 vaccines. It examines the issue of COVID-19 vaccine injury claims in a fresh, honest, and comprehensive manner with expert interviews, whistleblowers’ statements, and government health statistics."

Early Taiwanese cinematographers - whose voices appear on the soundtrack - were at the cutting edge of Taiwanese art, culture and politics. They brought an innovative approach to shooting, totally alien to the Western practices. This is the first time some footage being released from the vaults of the Chinese Taipei Film Archive since their first screenings decades ago. This is also the first film to present a perspective and authoritative portrait of Taiwan s troubled film industry."

With the backdrop of fearing the possibility of an earthquake hitting where the girls live, we learn about their friendship and its ups and downs. The girls have to prepare for their first Turkish bagpipe concert. But Emine is jealous of Eda Nur’s skills and that challenges her in keeping up the good friendship. Through the interactions between the two girls, we hope for Emine to acknowledge that she and Eda Nur are good at different things and that she sees the strengths of that in their friendship."

This documentary explores this reality from the perspective of young people themselves, instead of only hearing the experts in this matter. The film sounds the alarm, through face-to-face conversations between young people, listening to those who have already tried to commit suicide, others who are considering it, and above all those who are not yet thinking about it: the target audience for this film. With a narrative that targets 15-24 years old viewers, \"Silent Alarm\" uses language that speaks directly to them, building a bridge for open and transparent communication on this topic ."

What if life could be just a carefree stroll through a springlike world? This is the tenderly melancholic cinematic depiction of this walk, discovering the quiet beauty of people and things all around. Short and sweetly healing, like the warm caress of the sun on a beautiful day when you just want to get out and celebrate the fact that you’re alive; and free."

During his childhood, Biel is barely aware of what is happening. He is a gifted child who learns to read and write at home. However, the radicalization of the political and social clashes taking place around him turns Biel into a witness of horror. The story of a teenage boy through the most violent years in the history of Spain, years that will lead to the disenchantment with which Gabriel Ferrater and other members of his generation perceive the human condition."

A Bomb Squad detective, a fireman, an engineer for building 7, and an electrician give us a rare glimpse into the character of blue collar New Yorkers, faced with life and death situations. They reflect on how their sense of community, from growing up in an  old school  neighborhood, influenced them and how they continue dealing with the legacy of that historic day. It s an intimate portrait of friendship and resiliency as told to their buddy, in a uniquely Bronx way."

Yet, a formidable alliance of orthodox physicians and industrial titans hatched a cunning scheme to undermine any healing method that dared to defy the realms of pharmaceuticals and surgeries.  This is not just a movie; it s a riveting journey through a chapter in time that shaped the very foundations of our modern medical landscape.

As economic production became essential to military success, civilians were conscripted into factories – and suddenly became fair game. In Total War, eyewitnesses from Britain, Germany, Russia, Korea, Japan, and the United States tell the story of the civilians – children, sisters, and brothers – who suffered and died in the Second World War. Residents of Plymouth, Tokyo, and Hamburg remember the air raids; Russian peasants recall the siege of Leningrad; Japanese soldiers and Korean slave labourers describe the brutality of war in Asia. Throughout, interviewees remember the extraordinary suffering of a people’s war like none before. The people remember: Rosie the Riveter, shipbuilding, Pearl Harbor, air raids, the Blitz, the Siege of Leningrad, and the atom bomb. DVD. Viewing time: 1 hour."

Step by step, the desert’s wastes are conquered.” With 1,500 new immigrants settling in it every year, Eilat keeps growing. This film reviews various aspects of the unique development town on the beach of the Red Sea: its tourism and fishing industries, port, cultural life, city council, and adjoining Timna copper mines. The film portrays Eilat as fertile ground for the realization of Zionistic ideals: the conquest of the desert, the reviving of ancient history, and the development of the “New Jew” concept. However, the film does not conceal some of the problems the city faces: difficulties supplying water to its residents, scorching heat, and, as guests of the “End of the World Club” evince, a deficiency in the numbers of single women."

        "description": "In the Wake of Our Ancestors follows a group of dedicated Hawaiians, who embark on a journey to rediscover their past by building a voyaging canoe out of traditional natural materials. An extensive search fails to produce koa trees large enough for the hulls. The once plentiful forests on the island of Hawai’i have been depleted, and the unique koa ecosystem virtually destroyed.  Native Alaskans offer them two enormous Sitka spruce trees. After a dramatic tree felling ceremony in the forests of Southeast Alaska, the logs arrive in Hawai‘i, and builders begin shaping the canoe’s hulls. The generous gift from the Tlingit and Haida Indians of Southeast Alaska brings new hope for the canoe project and leads to discovery of strong cultural connections.  This story of an indigenous people’s frustrated search for trees that are endemic to their islands represents a microcosm of the threats facing diminishing native cultures and natural environments in the modern world."

Three new islanders realize that and have dropped anchor on Groix, an island in Brittany, rebellious but welcoming those who come to fulfill their project with an open heart: a doctor, because the island needs one; a divorced teacher who wants to rebuild her life; and an immigrant born of another Atlantic, who is so adaptable that he will be able to integrate.

It consists of an in-frame monologue, live clips, contacts with relatives, colleagues and other people, archive videos and photos. Separate interviews with other professionals, friends and relatives are missing from the film. This gap is filled by live contacts, dialogues and “following scenes”. Maestro introduces himself in different environments, in each of them he talks about his memories and thinks about cultural issues. There are many archival videos in the film, some of which were left in the shadows for some reason, for many people they will be pleasant discoveries."

Almost 40 years ago, he wrote atomic verses, which we have been living for the past four decades, but still today. And every time, when hope was created, we would fail to find shelter... From the same mistakes and the same stumbles. Boško and others like him were neither prophets nor visionaries, but they knew what was coming after... After hellish drivers, new careerists, the third world war. In vain, he urged his own, but also all future generations not to whine. \"Made in Pula\", by Rada Đurić, is a film that reminds and believes. He owes it to all those who do not give up."

The outcast child of a society that often has no room for those who do not fit into molds, Ciretta will find refuge and companionship among the people who gather around an old theater in Naples, now closed due to the pandemic. There he will dream of the possibility of a better life, until the theater is sold to become a hotel.

Mount Rushmore is carved into the granite spires of the Black Hills, which are sacred to the victims of the Wounded Knee massacre and their descendants. Today, Wounded Knee is located in one of the poorest counties in the United States with social and economic standards comparable to those of developing nations. By contrast, Mount Rushmore is a hub of tourism and commerce. The film approaches contrasts and the complex web of past and present relationships between the two memory sites through visual montage and interviews with the people who live at, work at and visit each of the memorials."

For mm 49 (in the 37th month of \"mm\" s history) a marathon listening party celebrating the music of Vivian Fine was decided upon.  Fine was a dedicated composer who produced a variety of work over a 70 year career. This movie, of course, is not an imitation of Ken Burns style documentary movie-making.  Instead, I gleefully mix the casualness & lively uninhibited conversation of mms with the formal exactitude of Fine s music.  I hope you enjoy it as an upstanding example of Punk Classical.  \"Bah to the Bourgeoisie\"!  Note that I m starting to disappear in this movie - will you miss me when I m gone?

Most broadly, “Fiddly Bits” considers how identity is navigated, negotiated, and constituted through the medium of miniature wargame figurines. Topics discussed include political geographies of the local wargaming community, gender stereotypes and counternarratives among hobbyists, and the extent to which customizing one’s miniatures may or may not be an articulation of the self. The film also depicts hobbyist techniques of sprue cleaning, assembly, painting, miniature organization, tool usage and maintenance, and error correction in comparative perspective."

Many of them, before they got to the village, could not connect even two words, they sat at home, within four walls. Svetlana avoids the words \"disabled\" or \"sick\", preferring to call such people \"guys\". They do not do miraculous healings and special trainings here, the diagnosis is not important here. Here the children simply create the conditions for a normal human life. Healthy and sick communicate on an equal footing, work together, put on performances and run a joint household. Disabled people do not feel sick and flawed. Everyone is equal here. The shooting of the film lasted about 13 years."

They organize themselves in online forums, run dating sites only for whites, or parade through small German towns like Wunsiedel in Bavaria every year with burning torches. They make no secret of their contempt for democratic institutions and want to specifically infiltrate the police and army. The ultra-right are no longer just agitating at the regulars  table, but are also showing an increasing willingness to use violence. In France, security authorities are also monitoring right-wing extremist groups. In 2022, French media revealed that there is a right-wing network within the French army that is openly committed to Nazi ideology. The racially motivated murder of Federico Aramburú in 2022 or the case of the right-wing agitator Daniel Conversano put the authorities on alert."

The book was non-judgemental, seeking to provide children with the information that adults had kept from them for years. And therein lay the anarchic rub."

Three hundred thousand American servicemen and women served in Northern Ireland from 1942 to 1945. Soldiers trained for the invasion of North Africa and Normandy, sailors fought the Battle of the Atlantic and U.S. airmen flew coastal patrols from Northern Ireland ports and bases. History has forgotten much of this, but the people still remember. And now GIs themselves return to Northern Ireland to complete the tale. Introduced by Walter Cronkite, who was himself a \"Yank in Ireland,\" the program follows World War II veterans back to their \"Home Away From Home.\" Secrets are revealed and old loves renewed in these moving stories. Rare photographs and archival film help tell the stories."

Meanwhile mental health nurses in Ghana are looking for ways to join together with healers in their communities. They know these healers are popular and respect their beliefs, but they are concerned that some use chains to restrain their patients. How can they work together with healers without threatening their reputation and livelihoods? And how can nurses offer treatment without access to medication and transport?"

Guardians of hunting quotas, animal species regulation, trackers and woodworking, the artist observed the organization of the hunting troops, the traditions and codes that survive and are perpetuated.  In her film Le Hameau, Bertille Bak plunges us into the world of this family, a timeless immersion in the Ursprung, which literally means \"the jump of the watch\" in Alsatian. Close to the research of the ethnologist and concerned by social conditions, Bertille Bak collects and archives the traces and testimonies of the people she meets. With melancholy derision and without taking sides, the film focuses on a singular reality. The result is a delicate questioning of the boundary between the domestic and the wild, the personification of animals and the precariousness of marginal lifestyles."

At the same time, the film is intended as an advertising film.

Only three white cubs have reached adulthood in the wilds of South Africa since white lions were first documented there in 1975. Now, two white cubs, sisters, have beaten the odds, surviving all the challenges of their youth with the help of two remarkable lionesses—their mother, Matimba, and their aunt, Khanya. Without an adult male lion to protect their small pride, Matimba and Khanya must rely solely on their own knowledge, strength and courage to protect their family."

Students are getting ready for elections, professors are also voting for deans, while a group of engineering students is totally engrossed in preparing for an international competition and doesn’t seem to notice any of this. They all want a better public university system, but how can they achieve it? We witness a crisis in the making. When students decide to occupy the university, it turns into a standoff between the government, professors and students. Finally, as Professor Vokos observes, “perhaps we’re afraid of facing reality.”"

Marzaroli s black-and-white photographs have become synonymous with a post-war Scotland in the throes of regeneration. They captured both the aspects of the old, such as the rag-and-bone man in the Gorbals or the cockle gatherers of Barra, and the paraphernalia of the new - cranes, towers and construction at Glasgow s Charing Cross.  As Glasgow s landscape changes once again and the high-rises that Marzaroli documented going up are gradually being razed to the ground, this film celebrates Marzaroli s remarkable photographic legacy."

Every town had a gas works, where gas was processed from the coal, and every gas works included a large storage device, a telescopic metal drum, often contained within an iron framework. Most of these were constructed between 1860 and 1890. The Gasometers in this film have now been removed and part of the removal process is documented in the film.

Serge is a man of legend, some consider him a genius of the Arctic ethnomodern, others attribute to him the scandalous fame of the \"Yakut Tarantino\". Potapov becomes a guide for St. Petersburg residents through the \"inner country of Sakha\" inhabited by the spirits of the Olonkho epic. At the end of June, the Sakha Republic celebrates the national holiday Ysyakh — Yakut New Year, a symbol of rebirth and abundance. The ancient ritual coincides with the birthday of the main character — and this is just one of the keys to unraveling the Yakut master, who saddles the currents of reality."

As the only participant from (what is colonially known as) British-Columbia and with only 3 weeks left, the pressure is on: Amélia rushes to find any traces of francophone queer people in Vancouver before the year 2000, the year they were born.  Amidst this chaotic research effort, they find André, an older French-Canadian gay man that lived in Vancouver for 25 years. Through their conversations, Amélia unlocks André s hidden personal visual archive, that proves that, indeed, francophone queers were alive and thriving years before they were born. This documentary shows how Amélia put together a presentation about their own queer ancestors through screen capture, archival footage, interviews and narration that ends up changing their own view of themself as a queer french-canadian in the west."

It wasn’t long before viral videos and sensationalized news reports of alleged Flakka overdoses started to spread across the internet, and people began comparing its effects to that of a zombie outbreak. One supposed incident involved a person who allegedly ate off a homeless man’s face on the side of a highway. The drug’s effects are often compared to that of bath salts, and include hallucinations, “superhuman\" strength, and a state of “excited delirium” that is credited with driving the lunatic actions of some users.  However, Flakka can be easily altered or changed, and reports have emerged that its recent incarnation has surfaced under a slightly new chemical—and just as dangerous—structure. VICE’s Matt Shea travels to Florida to meet both users and distributors to discover what’s really behind this zombie drug."

We begin an odyssey of discovery, exploring an acoustic instrument that has more parts than any other. It s history derived from an ancient Chinese \"mouth organ\" that used the \"free reed\" principle and continues up through today s electronically enhanced MIDI instruments. Along the way, various configurations of the same bellow-and-reed principle can be found in Concertinas, piano accordions, button boxes - and we hear how these instruments were adapted to play different kinds of music."

Then it disappeared.  Against the will of his mother, the filmmaker and son sets out to find the vanished piece of furniture in the place his family escaped 40 years ago, and finds a new perspective on the emigration. In sensitive and tragicomical observations, shot mise-en-scène in one building, this wild goose chase can also be seen as a social experiment about how much we are an oblivious product of history. The background are the mysterious and dramatic spring months of 1968 in Poland - a time that until today evokes a lot of controversy inside Poland while it is largely unheard of outside."

During his, Schützenhöfer showed Pilz the crumbling surroundings of Monticello, the former residence of President Thomas Jefferson, where the land hasn’t been cultivated for years and the former traditional crafts are gradually losing its fight to unequal competition with multinational companies. The film explores the persistent problems of the North American lifestyle, including disrespect for one s own homeland and its history, and the negligent treatment of nature and the landscape."

Within Dr. Bukhanovsky s clinic, we encounter three of his young patients: Edward and Igor, whose families express deep concerns about their disturbing fantasies, and  Mischa , who has perpetrated acts of torture and sexual assault. Dr. Bukhanovsky s approach is groundbreaking, offering treatment to potential serial offenders.

Certain character ideas of the parents of boyfriends and girlfriends, which are rarely accepted by the young people, contradict the open statements of the teenagers in front of the camera. Questions about contraception and the uncontrolled leisure activities of the pubescent pupils are included in the interviews, and their answers do not always correspond to their parents  ideas. During the final class trip to a youth hostel, the teachers in charge have their hands full keeping the teenagers under control and returning them safely to their parents  homes. Lydia talks openly about her \"first time\", but her parents are surprised to learn about their sheltered daughter s love affair via a tape recording."

There s a lot that is gone from contemporary New York in this documentary: a gritty Hell s Kitchen, a robust Model Cities program, and acres of slums in Bedford-Stuyvesant. But there s a lot that, for better or worse, is still the same: poverty and prosperity, diversity and wealth, greed and good intentions."

The challenges and uncertainties they encounter during filming strengthen the bond between Rachita and the filmmaker, fostering introspection on their beliefs, privileges, and inner struggles. The wait for the legal outcome adds stress, hindering Rachita s work. She seeks guidance and support from like-minded individuals dedicated to amplifying their voices. The film explores Rachita s inner world and her creative expression, depicting a dystopian narrative where freedom of speech rapidly erodes.

Instead of fighting poverty, the state fought the poor. In the participatory ethnographic documentary \"And then we were taken away\", two men in their sixties talk about the administrative foster care they experienced as a child. They lead the audience to the homes, locations of their tumultuous youth and to their favourite places. Through their biographies, the men document how out-of-home placements shaped their childhood, youth and present."

Though their large scale environmental projects, such as Running Fence and Wrapped Coast, are often met with distress and concern from the surrounding community, perceptions of the project are likely to shift when it comes time to interact with the grand, finished piece. Neither permanent nor purchasable, Christo and Jeanne-Claude’s works exude the essence of freedom and exist only for the sake of existing."

Through their presence, which might seem vain, at the funerals of strangers, these volunteers question the scope and meaning of such a commitment beyond religious beliefs. By offering a dignified ceremony to the most precarious, they contribute, in a spirit of brotherhood, to honoring their memory. For the true tomb of the dead is the heart of the living."

Some of the wedding customs have been preserved and are practiced today, others have experienced a transformation, and others were on the verge of being forgotten and were finally remembered in this film. Early and arranged marriages and the cult of virginity are an integral part of the Roma tradition.

Some have stood the test of time. Along the St. Lawrence River, between Berthier-sur-Mer and Miguasha, along almost a thousand kilometres of coastline, they have seen the wharves disappear from the villages and are now witnessing the proliferation of wind farms. In perfect harmony with the landscape. Deep-rooted, they hold their owners hostage or save their lives."

It is India’s duty to be loyal to this great truth, and never allow it to be extinguished by the storm of passion weeping over the present day world. That is why we must be careful today to try to find out the principle by means of which India will be able for certain to realise herself. That principle is neither commercialism nor nationalism, it is not nearly self determination, but self conquest and self dedication. The voice of this truth was heard in India’s forests of old above the din of race conflict.“"

While waiting in a hospital bed, he made a list of all the things he would do in his life if gifted with a successful transplant.  Three months later after a harrowing journey, he received the miracle of his new lungs, which began one of the greatest comebacks any transplant survivor could endeavor.  In the years following his transplant, Scott would go on to become the first person with a double lung transplant to complete a full Ironman, and now he has his sights set on The Crossing For Cystic Fibrosis - an 80-mile ocean challenge."

David was born and brought up in the idyllic village of Gillamoor, but he didn t want to take over the family pheasant farm, so he landed a job with an exclusive safari company in the Central African Republic (CAR). CAR has endured decades of unrest, and armed rebel groups roam the country, but for David, working in one of the world s last remaining wildernesses was a dream come true. However, as he opened up the bush for big game hunters, relations between the safari company and the local population became increasingly hostile. Villagers used the new roads to access rivers deep in the bush and start illegal gold mines. After a number of escalating confrontations between David and the miners, 13 men were found massacred at a gold mine."

He was succeeded in 1957 by Jack Paar, a skilled interviewer who got his start in radio and brought the art of conversation to the small screen. Johnny Carson followed as the next and undoubtedly most popular host of the show. He agreed somewhat reluctantly and became a TV staple for the next 30 years.

Commerce, belief systems, rituals and festivals, and the day-to-day responsibilities of women and men are described, with a special focus on the concept of “walking marriage.” But tourism and technology are swiftly eroding core Mosuo customs and values.

Featuring men and women skiers from Norway, France, Switzerland, Canada, the Netherlands, and Japan, this story serves as a reminder that sometimes the most profound communication occurs when words are not needed at all. From bottomless pow turns in majestic Japanese forests to the high volcanic alpine of central Hokkaido, Lexicon reminds us of the transformative power of adventure, cultural exchange, and the bonds we can create when we embrace our shared passions and the inherent joy of connecting with people from different walks of life."

Ivor Gurney wasn t an officer but a private who bizarrely joined up in the hope that the ordered army life would help ease a mental health condition. Initially this shock therapy worked, but he was eventually shot and gassed and spent the last 15 years of his life in an asylum. Yet the poetry he wrote there is uniquely powerful - capturing the experience of the ordinary soldier - and the film argues that it is the equal of the work of any of the more well-known soldier-poets of WWI. Gurney was also an accomplished composer and all the music used in the film is his, some of it hauntingly written on the Western Front."

This bionic implanted chip, that can make deaf people hear, is slowly reaching more secluded areas, even to El-Sayed which has neither paved roads nor electricity. Salim s decision is evoking great conflict in the village threatening the tradition of coexistence between deaf and hearing."

La Tumba Mambi is a docu-fiction film based on the Tumba Francesa, La Caridad de Oriente, which is located in the city of Santiago de Cuba. Through the Society s youngest member, Flavio, who is collecting information about the Tumba Francesa for a school project, we meet his grand-mother Andrea and mother Queli, two charismatic knowledge keepers of their rich cultural traditions. The original film soundtrack composed and produced by Cuban based DJ Jigüe, in collaboration with Tumba Francesa members, is a rhythmic and striking reminder that the present is grounded in a history of struggles for freedom."

The capital city is the product of unprecedented sprawl; though it has existed for less than a century, today it exceeds an area of 1,798 km2. The ramifications of this growth are vividly demonstrated in the Al-Manakh neighborhood, home to the behemoth Yamamah Saudi Cement Company (YSCC) founded in the 1960s and Al-Manakh Park, established in 2005. The YSCC produces 18,600 tons of cement per day; from this one factory, almost the entirety of the modern and postmodern city of Riyadh has been built. While the contribution of the factory to the Anthropocene is undeniable, it is somewhat negated by the breadth of biodiversity that has been cultivated by this strenuous closed The neighborhood’s inhabitants show tremendous passive resilience; the transfer of 60 years of heritable traits shape this adaptive strength, making Al-Manakh greater than the sum of its parts."

His generosity as a mentor, and his artistry as a lecturer on the poetry of Blake, Shelley and the Romantics made him unforgettable, life changing. He played a key role in the  Regionalist  art scene in London, Ontario in the 1960s which gave us many of Canada s most significant artists. Ross accompanied Marion through her journey as a pioneering Jungian analyst who brought the Feminine into depth psychology. Through the prism of Woodman s troubled life, the film maker explores the dynamic among, love, creativity and madness in movies, poetry and art."

The mix of black and white historical photographs and colour images taken with a camera obscura, together with sound, show the different places Flaubert visited.  The filmed sequences bear witness to the reality of today s island and its inhabitants. Gustave Flaubert s memories coincide with the everyday life of Corsica today.  The camera has researched the places he visited on his journey, met the inhabitants, as Flaubert did in his time, and is trying to determine whether his impressions of the time are still valid."

There remains a void, an empty space within us that no text written by man can fill. And so, after millennia we still ask the same questions about the existence of God and the meaning of our lives. But now we have a new science, a new understanding of our universe and it has opened up before us new possibilities and answers. Quantum physics explains much more than actions of sub-atomic particles, it reveals truths about our lives and ourselves; it fills the void that so many of us need to fill.

In a group there’s a competitive element, each tries to be the last one still upright; but it’s only, always, about inner sensation. A crazy, soaring dizziness, a drugless altered state, glimpsed in the unseeing inwardness of some eyes that remain half-open. Arms outstretch like wings, amplifying and balancing the whirl of abandon. To the soft beat of unconsciously synchronised steps, the camera moves down to capture long shadows, like images of the disembodiment being felt: ghostly rotations among the sand stones bare feet don’t feel."

A circle turns into a knot as the kids entangle themselves, still clutching, ever more twistedly, the same hands.* Once paralyzed, the group cries chorally for ‘Mother’ and she appears. With remarkable engineering flair, ‘Mother’ figures out how to unknot the knot without breaking the links of hands, shoving arms over heads and directing legs under and over. Suddenly, like a disentangled string of Christmas lights, the chain becomes circular again."

Eyes sockets and cheekbones prove useless against roundness; even the winning couple’s triumph is short-lived."

But how can each team’s turning score be counted? Is the ball as hard and painful as it sounds? How do you get “burned”? Does that give the other team the ball, or are there a set number of throws? Does deflecting the ball a long way with your plank count for anything? How did the winning team win? Why is the game called Stars?"

In 2011 thousands of Wisconsin citizens occupied the State House and the streets surrounding the capitol to protest the stripping of collective bargaining power from Wisconsin s public employees by the Republican-controlled legislature and newly elected governor Scott Walker. Dramatic footage shows more than 10,000 Wisconsinites pouring into the capitol, and Republican Senators fleeing on a secret shuttle. While Republican legislators invented new laws to restrict access by citizens—and even elected officials—to the State House, the occupation persisted."

Her decision to move to France and to marry director Yves Ciampi in 1957 – after he filmed her in Typhoon Over Nagasaki starring Jean Marais and Danielle Darrieux – caused a huge scandal in Japan.  Despite this transgression, Keiko Kishi continued acting in her home country with Kon Ichikawa, Yasujiro Ozu, Masaki Kobayashi… building unique bridges between Japanese and European cultures. Free and rebellious, she emancipated herself from the many obstacles she encountered in the film industry, and created her own production company in her early twenties.  Let’s look back at the story of a pioneer, an inspiration for many generations."

Throughout this journey, we get to the conclusion that memories are more than just static photographs in our minds, they re alive and in constant movement, changing while we evolve as individuals. These memories have influence and help us to move on."

The southern oasis, home to the cities of San Rafael and General Alvear, depends primarily on The Atuel River. Yet incredulously, the river remains under threat.  People cannot care for what they don’t know and so we decided to ask the river what story it would like to tell about itself. To do so, we travelled its entire length from its source in the heart of The Andes to where it dries out prematurely in the sands of The Cuyo Desert. We’re told we are the first to do so since 1884 and the first ever to do so by boat.  43 days. 480 kilometres. 38 people interviewed about their relationship with the river."

The artist died of cancer in December 2004 before Jennifer could film him again. After inheriting his studio, she found herself in this sacred space, still imbued with the presence and imagination of her father. Her film is an attempt to prolong the dialogue, to find the missing fragments of her father’s life. Edmund Alleyn was an intense and complex man of integrity who left his mark on Canadian art history."

For the first time, a seven-year investigation is being carried out into the history of the Jewish deaf under Nazism. It began in 1993, with a debate organized at the Bagnolet library, which showed that the deaf, gagged by their inability to speak, were unable to testify. Numerous testimonies, interspersed with images of the places where sterilizations took place (Hadamar hospital, Berlin...) and the Auschwitz museum, support this discussion. Historians such as Horst Biesold, a specialist in the problem of the deaf under Nazism, break the silence, unmasking the perverse logic of the Nazi regime in terms of racial hygiene and the annihilation of the disabled, and denounce the crucial role played by doctors in this sinister process."

It is the life progression of a young, superb athlete and all-around active man to an older individual, facing a horrible medical condition that is slowly shutting down his brain and his ability to move.  Using my grandfather’s story as a reference, I would like to reflect on the lessons that he has taught me as someone who was diagnosed with a chronic illness in 2022. Specifically, the humor that he exudes or how to enjoy the small things when you are facing hard times."

The name of the project derives from the delicate yet gruelling process of shooting tricks on film. “Now that I understand skateboarding a little more, I wanted to pay tribute to its subversive form, its poetic form,” says Bayle of the feature, describing a “precious feeling I had when I started skateboarding and which, as I have gotten older, I ve tended to forget.”  In encapsulating this, he employs a multi-sensory approach. Warm, gauzy footage is punctuated by shutter clicks and black and white photography. Quiet moments of reflection are interrupted by the sound of wheels on concrete. Softly spoken word drifts in and out of a soundtrack of sludge metal and synthwave."

They also emphasize that the materialism and stress to which current society subjects us prevent us from searching for consciousness, leading us to distance ourselves from nature.  In this way, the documentary leads the viewer to reflect on the current health system.

These films will take you, beyond borders, to discover urban subcultures under a new light. Urban Visons includes both the extraordinary as well as the perfectly ordinary. It s about everyday life, real and unreal, as seen through the eyes of independent and cutting-edge film-makers with a dedication to form, rhythm, and color. These works are witness to a new wave of film as art without limits of creativity and style and free of technical and financial constraints. Urban Visions proves that now just like the big city, anything is possible."

From the summits of the island to the luxuriant forests, passing by rivers, swamps, beaches and mangroves, the diversity of landscapes and ecosystems offers a wide variety of spectacular panoramas.  Even if it is very frequented by tourists and has many inhabited areas, the island of Guadeloupe is also the land of a discreet, almost invisible people: the animals. They knew how to find their place, near or far from humans. We know of their existence. We have sometimes seen them; we have often been close to them. But rarely really approached.  From the summits of the island to the depths of the ocean that surrounds it, this 100% wildlife film takes us to the most remarkable animals of Guadeloupe."

In these interviews, and in a supplemental survey, I ask how these citizens feel about the 2020 election, the events of January 6th and the current state of American democracy. To fully showcase this research, I use these interviews to create a documentary . The interviews and survey illustrate that the rural-urban divide continues to be a good predictor of political opinion, with rural participants tending to be more forgiving of, or even uninterested in, the insurrection."

His trial was one of the most stunning spectacles in the history of justice, and the wild-eyed killer became synonymous with evil. In two nights in 1969, Charles Manson and a ragged band of followers rewrote the standards of criminal brutality, killing seven people including actress Sharon Tate in the cruelest ways imaginable. When the killers were finally caught, the nation was introduced to the small, bizarre, ex-con who was the guru of a ragtag \"family.\" In riveting interviews, Manson and \"family\" members speak out. Charles Manson and \"Squeaky\" Fromme are still unapologetic for what happened, but Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten understand fully now what they did and express it forcefully and eloquently."

On the surface, Charles Whitman would have seemed as steady and upstanding as the tower itself - he came from a wealthy, prominent family in Lake Worth, Florida, was a gifted student, an accomplished pianist and an Eagle Scout. But this veneer could not be further from the truth as this look inside his warped mind reveals. On August 1st 1966, Charles Whitman climbed the University of Texas Clock Tower with his high-powered rifles and killed 14 people and wounded 31 others. Interviews with those who knew him well and excerpts from Whitman s own writings reveal how his murderous personality was formed and why his violent nature remained hidden for so long."

Louis Llech, a Perpignan based shopkeeper and enlightened amateur cineaste, owned a 16mm camera. Together with his friend Isambert, he filmed this extraordinary migration. Fascinated by the military aspect of this Retirada, he favoured shots of parades, of crowds, like those showing military equipment. He nonetheless also showed civilian distress, without insisting on its picturesque aspects, focussing more on images of the uninterrupted flow of refugees."

In the author s own words, this documentary can be summarized as follows: \"Historical memory has usurped the place of political memory. The normalizing machine stifles the power of the story, confines revolutionary ruptures in the straitjacket of melodrama. Why \"Is there so much emphasis on exclusively sentimental recoveries of the past?\" The documentary \"Causa 661/52\" investigates, based on the history of the Guerrilla Group of Granada and Málaga, the keys to this displacement."

The French authorities order the construction of a camp on the beach... The film evokes the existence of the Argeles sur Mer concentration camp (Pyrénées-Orientales), from its creation in January 1939 to its closure in September 1941. In 1939 , filmmakers and activists, shocked by this camp, managed to smuggle a camera behind the wire fence. The few images taken directly from the Argeles camp were filmed with a hidden camera and many were seized and destroyed. “El Campo de Argeles” proposes to recreate these lost images and intersect camp life with archival images and testimonies collected throughout Europe: former internees in the camp (Spanish Republicans, Jews...) and also guards and witnesses."

Documentary maker Camiel Zwart shows how young people are held captive by sky-high debts, fines, interest and interest on fines. Every day they struggle in the bureaucratic merry-go-round that the debt industry entails. We follow young people from Amsterdam Zuidoost in sometimes hopeless financial situations. Ricky has been trying to get his life on track for seven years. But how do you do that without an income and a permanent home address? Elyvonne received a debt claim when she was 18, because her school books were not paid for when she was twelve. The tax authorities, collection agencies and insurers are unrelenting; If payment is not made, you will simply be charged a fine with interest."

The film narrates his experiences during the conflict, his fears, his hunger, which became more acute after 1937 when Madrid was isolated by Franco s troops. The memories of the protagonists are interwoven with archival images and with the testimony of Eduardo Haro Tecglen and several other people, respecting the silences and pauses in which the interviewees relax the emotions that these memories stir up in them. A cinematic beast s blow where life becomes death: the story of a childhood lost in the midst of embers, hunger and blood."

This isolated village, of about 85 neighbors, suffered one of the most painful forms of punishment: deportation of adults to concentration camps, separating them from their minor children.

The Universe was born as a result of an explosion of a small superdense clot of matter, which had great energy, which began to scatter in different directions. But how did the planets and, ultimately, life itself come from energy? Thousands of scientists are looking for the answer to this question. Peter Higgs is the most expensive scientist for the world economy. His theory of the birth of the universe has already cost taxpayers 6 million euros. And this is not the limit. The Large Hadron Collider, which is capable of confirming the Higgs theory, has not even begun to operate at full capacity. And many are sure that they will never start."

Together with his colleague Vladimir Skulachev, he proved Mitchell s hypothesis about energy exchange in a cell. This was the second most fundamental discovery, after the discovery of the DNA double helix. In the late 70s, Efim Lieberman created a theory of the quantum computer and the quantum nature of consciousness, many decades ahead of time. And at the end of his life, he sets himself the task of creating new knowledge that unites all sciences and religion."

We met near Beitou in Taiwan and got to know each other through exchanges in temples, homes and mountainsides—sharing time and stories. Starting with audio recordings that capture everyone’s most cherished tales held deep within their hearts; video serves as an abstract index using smoke as a metaphor—a vessel linking our various wishes for transformation to another realm."

The foundation aimed to supply humanitarian aid to the Palestinians in Palestine and countries hosting Palestinian refugees, it later became the largest charity association in the US to distribute humanitarian aid to Palestinians. After 9/11, the former US President George W. Bush issued a decision to shut down the Holy Land Foundation and freeze its assets. In 2007 the Holy Land Foundation trials began, where five of its members were charged with funding terrorism and sending money to Hamas, a blacklisted political group in the US. A second trial for the Holy Land Foundation members took place in 2008, which issued the convictions of five members of the Foundation and their sentencing of 65 years imprisonment."

The lesson begins with the teacher explaining the hormonal mode of action of oestrogen and progestogen, whose explanations are supplemented by intermittent images of the schematic diagram on the blackboard. Prompted by questions from the pupils, the teacher then goes into the production of the corpus luteum and explains its function. She then discusses the effect of the  pill  as an ovulation inhibitor on the female organism. She explains that the preparations absorb the hormone progestin, which prevents further follicle maturation. Further questions are asked about other contraceptive methods. The teacher first explains the Knaus-Ogino method and then talks about the mechanical contraceptive concepts of condoms and pessaries. Finally, the chemical methods and  coitus interruptus  are discussed as further options for preventing pregnancy."

In the 1964 General Election, a swing to the Conservative Party in Labour’s Smethwick constituency and Enoch Powell’s “rivers of blood” speech on immigration four years later put attitudes towards ethnic minorities on the political and social agenda. In One British Family, made in 1974, John Pilger focuses on Gus and Julie Gill, who arrived in Britain from Trinidad in 1961. They now had three children and their own house on Tyneside, where they were the only black family in the street. “They take less from the social services than the equivalent white families,” says Pilger. “They’re not on any council’s housing lists and they’ve never been out of work.”"

The other reference in their conversation is the execution of dozens of animals at the Yuanshan Zoo in Taiwan in 1944, intended to prevent civilian casualties caused by animals after the US military had bombed the cities. These unfortunate animals were later turned into taxidermy. Drawing on these historical observations, ‘The Zoo Hypothesis’ explores the role of technology in archiving the world and constructing human memory. At its center lie the tense relationships between animals and humans, and between matter and memory."

        "description": "The Secret History of Aviation is a poignant reflection on that which rises and that which falls. Its title and narration are taken from a piece written by Manuel Zimbro, in which he muses on what it is that prevents man from being able to fly, and what impact this limitation has on the natural world. The images collated in this film trace the devastation left by the fires of 2017 – the worst year on record in terms of damage to Portugal s forests. It reminds us that to jump up into the air is, inescapably, to come back down to the ground again."

I don’t think I’ve ever had such strong reactions to a city. This film is an expression of much of that and weaves together several elements: a visual portrait of Las Vegas; informal, verite-ish interviews with a wide range of interesting people we came across while shooting; archival images of the city from the 1950s and 60s; along with some first-person voice-over musings about the city and its history. My hope is that this film does justice to the endlessly fascinating, spectacularly libidinous, and deeply disturbing nature of Las Vegas and its history. —Sam Green"

Conflict that has driven them little by little to forget and abandon their ancestral knowledge and ancient spiritual practices. Today it is a desire for them to return to walk in the footsteps of their ancestors and recover their uses and customs. Given this and their great concern for the revitalization of Mother Earth in times of climate change, they decide to re-practice one of their major rituals from their roots, whose sole objective is the offering of a sacrifice to Mother Earth, in order to connect in community with the spirits of nature, claiming for the mistreatment of man and thanking them for life. This offering is a tree called \"Saakhelu\"."

The pressure and overload on her reveal a cycle of violence. In an honest and direct way, the documentary is a trigger of unease, exposing the negligence of parental abandonment."

In this context, the islet could have sunk under concrete and pollution, and the reef could have been irreparably impacted. However, thanks to the will of a handful of inhabitants including the mayor of the island, Bora Bora is today a model of sustainable development, with water treatment technologies that are 15 years ahead of France, programs to rebuild corals and protect wildlife, educational actions and the rehabilitation of Polynesian traditions such as “rahui” and the establishment of a monitoring network using new technologies. All of this makes the island a veritable open-air laboratory that shows the way for all tropical coastal environments around the world."

In this film, Naess tells about the concept of  deep ecology , which was first introduced by him in 1973. One of the basic tenets of deep ecology is that nature has a value in itself, apart from its possible use value to humans. Next to being a famous mountaineer, Naess has been a longtime activist in the environmental movement. He gives an inspiring account of his participation in blockades to prevent the Alta river in northern Norway (the area of the Sami, an indigenous people) from being dammed."

In Ans en het universum, for one last time, she recalls her out-of-body experiences and her visits to other planets. Ans also discusses her media appearances and how people would call her crazy, but still, Ans did not have one shred of doubt: aliens are everywhere and we’re slowly transitioning to an era where current gender norms are no longer applicable.  Filmmakers Noëlle Ingeveldt and Juriaan van Berkel work together as Berkveldt to produce a sincere testimonial of a woman with a remarkable life story, filmed amongst the many dolls Ans made in the same likeness of her alien friends."

        "description": "Elements of a Journey: Antoni Tàpies is an experimental documentary focusing on the legacy of Antoni Tàpies, the 20th century Catalan painter and sculptor who died in 2012. The film, which follows the artist growing up during the dictatorship of Franco, is strongly relevant to the divisive politics of today. Its goal is to engage viewers who are looking for stories of how artists personally navigate complex journeys; spiritual, political and everyday. Tàpies stood out in his lifetime, not only as a major painter but also as the voice of freedom and hope for an entire generation during a very dark period in Spain’s history."

Decades later, the hundreds of martyrs’ children, now adults, are dispersed in several countries. The long abandoned orphanage still stands bearing the scars of civil war.

Have to Endure It, which draws attention to sexual harassment and abuse of power in Czech art schools.  For years, the rampant sexism and bullying that exist behind the walls of many Czech universities have escaped media attention. In 2021, Marie-Luisa Purkrábková decided to speak out about toxic university relationships. She invited her DAMU (Faculty of Performing Arts) classmates to do the same. As the co-founder of the feminist initiative You Don t! Have to Endure It, she has become the voice of a humiliated student body for many. In this documentary, she shares the joy of her small successes as well as her doubts regarding how long she can face the pressure of such a responsible role. Scenes from her private life and public appearances create a portrait of a woman who clearly understands that even when pushing for far-reaching changes, one cannot afford to ignore one’s own health."

The key difference being that we wanted to avoid filming only \"pro\" riders and instead wanted to capture a diverse range of skill levels. The winter of 2021/22 was especially wet in Bellingham with the \"atmospheric river\" bringing in especially foul conditions. Most self respecting mountain bikers would have hung up their helmet for the season but many of our local river rats continued on with their trail building and riding. Despite mud, grit, snow, hail and torrential rain our local riders were still out there. Capturing these creatures in their natural habitat was our goal. We proudly present to \"Atmospheric River Rats\" a Bellingham community mountain bike movie."

The first question Michael answered was:\r I have a question about the attitude (bhavana) one should hold when conducting self-investigation. There are 2 different ideas I can read in Bhagwan s teachings:  The first being \"Investigating the Self as I\" or \"Who am I\" or \"What am I\" or \"I am I\". The second is \"God is I\" or \"Bhagwan is shining as I\" or \"I am Brahman\"\r They both lead to attention on the self, but the feeling is subtly different. The first one is more analytical, and driven by a curiosity. The second one devotional, and is driven by a longing to be one with Bhagwan. I understand that these ultimately the same path, but to me these carry subtly different perfumes. Can you comment in this, please?"

Only after his death and curious about the truth behind Arnie’s stories, the director uncovers the story of this outstanding musician. This film follows the last days of iconic American jazz musician Arnie Lawrence, who fell from fame to homelessness in Israel where he created a bridge between people through music.

Jorge Pena Hen was a composer and conductor. He was also among the tens of thousands arrested and killed after the coup which brought down the democratically-elected socialist Allende government. Restaging Fidelio in an abandoned factory in Valparaíso, Candaele meets Pena Hen’s granddaughter, Maria, who dedicates her art form — Butoh dance — to memorializing her grandfather, and sees surprising echoes of the opera in her tale.  Love & Justice has it all: Beethoven’s stirring music and singing, history, politics, but above all it’s an inspiring testament to the enduring power of creativity and artistic expression, even in the hardest times."

Alike how the alleyway is a physical bridge between two main streets, the film presents a series of juxtaposed images that might seem opposing at a glance – the seer and the seen, the outside and inside, young and old, low and high, the leaving, coming, and returning – but are co-existing elements that sustain the living and breathing of the alleyway. The tactility of witnessing inherently embodied by the 16 mm celluloid is mirrored by the witnessing(s) of the tourists, the residents, the non-human subjects in the space. Via a constructed soundscape in which sonic elements from eastern spirituality find their prominence amongst real-life sounds, and through an embodied camera eye that moves freely in the geographical space of the alley, the film evokes a sense of magical realism which gives texture to the meditation on the Chinese American identity."

In the span of 79 years since the purchase of this camera, Iran has undergone two revolutions and two coups, and throughout all these moments, the camera has been present as the recorder of people s mesmerized gazes. These mesmerized gazes are in a way as if they are the ones looking at us, not the other way around. It seems like these gazes are trying to convey something, but what? No one knows.

Not the steepest, or the hardest, but when the Tour de France hits Alpe d’Huez, drama is guaranteed. It’s featured more than thirty times and is eagerly awaited by hordes of fans lining the route. Crowds are estimated to  have swelled to over a million and on one of the sport’s most recognisable bends all of Holland seems to camp out; the iconic Dutch Corner.  Conor is joined by ex-pro Fränk Schleck who won on the mountain in 2006. His victory cemented his place at cycling’s top table, and Fränk’s name is now immortalised on hairpin eighteen, alongside double stage winner, Hennie Kuiper, who also shares his memories of the mythical mountain."

But although focused on the study of groupers, the real surprise came from the sharks. Never before had the team been confronted with such a density of grey reef sharks. The divers took up the challenge of counting them. Methodically, they repeated the operation many times to arrive at the impressive figure of 700 grey reef sharks.\r Each year, the team returned to the southern pass of Fakarava in French Polynesia. Until 2019, for the fourth expedition, \"Gombessa 4\" is the synthesis of precise and unique scientific protocols. The mission demonstrated that shark hunts are not anarchic, but rely in part on social organization within the horde, following in the footsteps of the 700 grey sharks in \"700 sharks in the night (Gombessa 4, Genesis)\"."

Giri translates as ‘duty’ in Japanese, but the concept is in fact far more complicated. Giri is a sort of interpersonal political capital that informs careers, family relations, and much more. Its presence and flow is palpable in Japan, where this film was shot. A “giri chit” then may be a hypothetical voucher for this intangible flow (with a tip of the cap to Thomas Pynchon’s “Vineland”).

The collapse of the Sampoong Department Store was a national trauma broadcast across the nation for nearly a month.  Sampoong had begun as a construction company in the ‘60s and was one of the backbones of Korea’s rapid development. Sampoong raced on ahead without any time to look back during this generation of growth and development. The fact that it all ended in a major disaster is a result of the social problems we had all created. We look back on the tragedy 25 years later with the CEO of Sampoong at the time, Lee Hansang."

For “Who, If Not Us? The Fight for Democracy in Belarus,” Juliane Tutein filmed and researched for three years in a country that had not seen a change of elites with its supposed independence in 1991. She discovered mainly women at the forefront of the courageous protesters. This portrait is dedicated to three of them: Nina Baginskaya, in her mid-seventies and active in the fight for an open Belarus since the 1980s, Tatsyana “Tanya” Hatsura-Yavorskaya, founder of the human rights film festival “Watch Docs”, and Darya Rublevskaya, the youngest at 22, who works for the “Viasna” human rights centre founded by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski."

Analysing historical photographs, he exposes the perfidious mechanisms of colonial historiography and contrasts them with conversations with traditional scholars. They represent an exploited culture confronted not only with the theft of economic goods. It was also robbed – in a historical dimension, too – of self-perception and self-determination."

The film is centered on a case study: the never-completed Nazi resort of Prora, on Germany’s Baltic Sea, which was built on a mammoth scale beginning in 1936 to house 20,000 vacationing working-class Germans. This 4-mile-long building was used in propaganda to forward a promise of leisure time for the masses and strengthen sympathies between the workers and the Nazi party. Although the Nazis left the site unfinished, the Socialist East German government continued construction in the 1950s, using it for military training as well as housing for conscientious objectors pressed into labor by the GDR regime. After decades of abandonment, the massive edifice is now being redeveloped into apartments, condominiums, hotels, and a youth hostel."

They have no memory of the events – neither those whose fathers were murdered nor those whose parents were responsible. A confrontation begins: focused conversations between generations which, captured by a gentle camera, are meant to cautiously break the long silence – in order to be able to understand, process and mourn."

The early asphalt sections would suit the Ford Sierra RS Cosworths of Didier Auriol and Stig Blomqvist, whilst the ‘87 champion Juha Kankkunen was hoping to restore some pride with a good drive in the Toyota Celica GT-Four.  Italian rally fans were out in force to back Biasion driving the Lancia Delta Integrale as he tried to clinch his first World Championship crown, on home ground.  The battle for the Group N title was another that could be settled at Sanremo, with Argentinian Jorge Recalde and Belgian Pascal Gaban arrived at the start on level pegging, with just one more round to go in the Championship."

Uncharacteristic weather beset the Italian Riviera and further assisted the four-wheel drive cars, but could Markku Alen win again after the 1986 Peugeot exclusion debacle?  Massimo “Miki” Biasion perhaps was the man most likely to upset the hopes of the Finn, and with the Manufacturers’ title already secured by Lancia, there was no particular team orders in operation, or so it seemed.  With the patriotic crowds firmly behind the Martini-sponsored Lancia’s the stage was set for a great showdown with Jean Ragnotti in the Renault 11 Turbo and Didier Auriol driving an RED Ford Sierra Cosworth.  Britain’s Jimmy McRae used his success in the Tudor Webasto Manx International Rally to land a drive in a second Cosworth, but with five other Lancias in the fray the result was was going to be well-earned by whoever made it to the top step of the podium."

In her lyrics, angels and demons coexist within a rural landscape, where the different elements of nature are exalted and disturbed with a unique poetic flight. She was also an extraordinary and absolutely authentic character. Her work, which has received numerous awards, has been translated into English, French, Portuguese and Italian. In The Wild Papers (with various editions) her very unique poetry is gathered."

The CineKursaal went through the Nazi occupation, survived the devastation of World War II, resisted the growing success of television in the 1970s, and renewed itself by automating the projection room in the late 1980s. Not even the advent of multiplexes, the temporary closure of theaters due to the pandemic, and the growing success of streaming platforms were able to interrupt the CineKursaal s glorious history. Through the personal recollections of its owner Raymond Massard, great-grandson of Conrad Massard who first managed the cinema in 1911, the short documentary tells the story of a cultural infrastructure rooted in Luxembourg s history. Archival materials and immersive video overlap in an intimate narrative that celebrates the cinema s past, reflects on its present, and looks to its future."

Both the Almanac and the laboratory. How successful this experiment is will be judged by the audience. In any case, it took place. And here is a series of attentive, thoughtful, concerned or ironic, but always caring and independent views of young authors on the reality that surrounds them. To see a separate human face in a crowd also means to keep your own. In any crowd... which is thus personified and gets a chance to turn into a society. The thought is not new, but it needs to be reminded."

These practices are presented through the lens of a musical family trained during Bulgaria s communist regime (1944-1989) to represent the best that Bulgaria had to offer the world, but who made the wrenching decision in the post-communist period to immigrate to the United States for the sake of their daughters  futures.

Enjoy incredible action, interviews with the stars and some spectacular  moments  in these excellent highlights."

Local hero Recaldo with co-driver Jorge del Buono, led the field in one of the Lancia Delta Integrales but despite a flying start chose the wrong tyres. The challenge from Mikael Ericsson, Fiorio, Soto and Fischer led to some exciting duels and traumatic events which quickly whittled down the number of competitors. Only 33 crews completed the gruelling course out of the 77 starters. A memorable event faithfully recorded here for your enjoyment."

With Bjorn Waldegard and Lars-Eric Torph to drive them, Team Europe certainly looked set to continue Japanese success.  But it wasn t just the Toyotas who were in good shape. On their appearance, Volkswagen entered ex-Safari Rally cars for Erwin Weber and Kenneth Eriksson. Nissan had 200SXs for Mike Kirkland, Alain Ambrosino and the vastly experienced Shekhar Mehta.  Plunging through the undergrowth, roaring along dried-out lakes, lurching into deep water-holes and racing through sparsely populated villages are all featured in this film."

The heat and dusty conditions took their toll of men and machinery, and the cameramen have excelled themselves in providing you with the finest coverage of this, one of the most picturesque locations for a rally in the world."

The Lancia Delta HF Turbos, in the hands of Markku Alen, Miki Biasion, Mikael Ericsson and Juha Kankkunen, were expected to provide the main threat, while Audi fielded two new 200 Quattros for Hannu Mikkola and Walter Rohrl, who had finished first and second on the Safari. Kankkunen had won the Acropolis in 1986 on his way to the World Championship, and was confident of giving the Martini Racing Team victory. But on the demanding, dusty back lanes and tracks of the Kamena Vourla, the stronger challenge was thought to be more likely from the big Nissans. This video captures all the excitement of the furious pace of the Acropolis, mixing as it did, dry, flat-out sprints alongside rain-lashed hillsides in the later parts."

Recognised as a cut and thrust affair where results are often decided by seconds rather than minutes, the 1000 Lakes lived up to its reputation as a tough and demanding drive and on top of the treacherous weather conditions caused by the heavy rain, cars were decimated by mechanical failure and driver error over the 1,447 km course."

The Toyota Celica GT-Four in the fast care of Juha Kankkunen provided one of the highlights and Mazda made a rare appearance with two 323 Turbos for Timo Salonen and Hannu Mikkola. Add to these, Ari Vatanen in the BMW M3, and you can see why the 1000 Lakes rates so high in all rally drivers esteem."

As usual Videovision were there to capture the action set in some of the finest and scenic pictures of the year on the rally calendar. The Sierra Cosworths were making their debut at this venue. Driven by British Open Champion Jimmy McRae and son Colin –the latter proved to be a sensation in his first Group A world championship rally, the 2-wheel drive Cosworths were spectacular especially on the gravel and this was sure to make life exciting for the McRaes. The British were certainly in force with Malcolm Wilson driving a 2WD Vauxhall Astra GTE who gave the British something to cheer about with a superb performance."

The slippery conditions caught out many competitors, the quagmire bordering most stages causing havoc, when even the best service crews took an hour to rescue cars which strayed but a few feet from their chosen course!

They press bunches of straw into the sand to combat the desertification and sandstorms here in the Tengger Desert of northwest China. A little later we see other people, men and women, doing the same work. In this immense swathe of sand—the Tengger is about the size of the Netherlands— their labor looks like a Sisyphean task. Perhaps it is due to the resulting sense of pointlessness that the conversations start to take on a more serious tone. One of the two men tells of how his wife left him, and how he had to raise his child alone. He once envisioned a different kind of life, but things go as they go. “Our fate is like an unbreakable wall,” he observes, with a resigned tone."

Even two world wars and severe economic depression could not deter Australians from pursuit of “the fair go”. By the 1950s most middle class Australians lived in an ordered, protected, prosperous world of school, employment, Saturday afternoon sport and the Sunday roast.  Yet today Australia is following the global trend towards a population divided between the overworked and the underemployed. The old 9 to 5 certainties are no longer in place. People work from home via computer; shop in non-stop trading supermarkets seven days a week; and online 24 hours a day. Overtime has increased and penalty rates are disappearing."

The Filipino émigré’s identity is a dynamic one, constantly changing and adapting to one’s adopted community, while at the same time attempting to compromise with one’s responsibilities with their family and with their Filipino culture. This documentary explores the stories of some of these 21st century Filipino émigré who used to be state scholars but have since followed other opportunities abroad. As these friends send a video camera to each other by courier and share their stories, they open up about adulthood and moving away, teasing out larger themes such as the Philippine s labor export economy, nationalism, and internationalism."

ARGENTINA\r The Championship had reached fever pitch by the Argentinian round. Both Lancia and Peugeot were desperately trying to recruit experienced drivers to boost their chances. Peugeot managed to secure the services of a certain Stig Blomqvist - and by the end of the rally the team had cause to thank him. His crucial third place had saved the day for Peugeot even though it was Lancia’s rising star Miki Biasion who had finally taken his first major win. With Kankkunen sidelined by mechanical problems, Alen’s second place closed the points gap in the Championship race and the rallying world looked forward to the next battle - the 1000 Lakes!"

As this video forcibly demonstrates, the terrain of the 2,600 mile event provided a severe challenge, taking crews first to the south-east of Kenya, including the night-drive through the Taita Hills. Marku Alen in the Lancia showed that his vivid style is not restricted to tarmac road events, while Lars-Eric Torph (Sweden) provided admirable back-up to Waldegaard. The punishing heat, strength-sapping sand and grass lanes and dunes tested the world championship aspirants to the limit, and it s here on this film waiting to be seen and re-seen."

In European science, the geocentric view revolving around the stationary planet Earth was replaced with a solar one, the Copernican heliocentric model, in the 16th century. Earth appears here as part of a larger cosmic order of things, its fate connected to that of the other bodies in ceaseless motion. The detached eye of the rational mind is replaced in the video by two embodied subjects. Hesitant and exploratory, the hands appear in search of a shared rhythm rather than assuming the place of a universal man making the world go around."

With the introduction of the Lancia 037 and Audi Quattro A1 in the early 1980s, World Rallying had entered the supercar age and the big money attracted big name drivers and made for sensational showdowns on gravel, ice, tarmac and snow.

The Tour de Corse is an all-asphalt rally, and the stages include narrow mountain roads with huge drops just inches away – it is always a true challenge of skill and bravery, and the 1984 running was no exception.  Alongside the new cars from Peugeot and Audi, the field included the dominant Lancias and Renault 5 Turbos.  The all-star driving cast includes Markku alen, Mikki Biasion, Stig Blomqvist, Walter Rohrl, Ari Vatanen.  It proved an incredible debut for both Peugeot and Audi, and an unpredictable battle throughout – including the unlikely alliance between the French and Italians against the rising threat of the Germans."

Salonen in the diminutive Peugeot pursued constantly by Blomqvist in the almighty Audi Quattro. See the heart-stopping, all-action style as the world’s finest crews slide through the endless corners, throwing up huge clods of earth and raising mushrooms of dust. Some of the terrain’s horrendous rockery is also depicted with car after car bumping frighteningly close to disaster. But through it all, Salonen kept steady, ignoring faster times set by his rival. Consistency brought the 205 Turbo 16 home ahead of the Quattro, and the myth that early Acropolis leaders always faded was finally laid to rest."

Nevertheless, Salonen and the Peugeot are established as the champions for 1985.

The Lancias made a welcome comeback and added colour to an event, which turned out more a test of stamina than predicted.

Among other things, she championed for women’s liberation, helped organise the first International Women’s Day, worked to advance women’s labour, welfare, and education rights, and was an advocate for sexual emancipation, abortion rights, and civil partnerships instead of traditional marriage. After working in the Bolshevik government for a few years, she became sidelined and ostracised, and narrowly avoided her expulsion from the party by serving in several diplomatic posts outside Russia, including Norway, Mexico, and Sweden."

That situation was reached after Peugeot protested against their exclusion from the San Remo event in Italy, which significantly affected the points score. However, as the cameras show to great advantage, the action on the Olympus Rally was fast and furious, with local star John Buffum going really well in a semi-official works Audi Quattro and providing substantial opposition to the big two. But all eyes were on the Flying Finns as they ignored the political wrangles and got on with the driving. Hurtling along the smooth wooded straights and screaming round the curves, the French and Italian manufacturers top men tried all they knew."

In 1986, the event was rocked by a series of serious accidents, and a tragedy which would stun the sport.  An horrific helicopter accident in Mali killed five, including Dakar Rally founder Thierry Sabine. The tragedy shocked everyone involved in the 1986 event, but it was decided to complete the rally raid in Sabine s honour. So, 22 days after leaving Paris, the surviving cars, motorcycles and trucks rolled into Dakar, bringing an emotional end to the 15,000km adventure.  Treacherous terrain, wild weather, confusion and controversy made 1986 one of the toughest years for the Dakar Rally, with just 81 of the 478 competitors making the finish. This comprehensive review follows the dramatic story, with extraordinary action footage, interviews and rare behind-the-scenes access putting you at the heart of the 1986 Paris-Dakar Rally."

His music, a mix of industrial, hip-hop, techno, and dubstep, and usually without any lyrics, could never easily be identified for its politics. But his pro-Palestinian beliefs were at the center of his inspiration. As the head of Muslimgauze s first long-term record label recalls about their first meeting, \"We didn t talk about music, we talked about politics and the whole situation that brought his music to life.\"Mixing news broadcast recordings, drum kit beats, pots and pans, and classic instrumentals, Muslimgauze pioneered a new style of music that sounded little like anything else at the time or since."

Following the unplanned format of EP/64 concerts, director James Hankins put a call out before the show for 64 fans to record anything they could from these final performances. Everything you see and hear was filmed over that final weekend.  EP/64 was initiated following a dream Dali had about in which she was in a record shop, looking for an LP by an ‘ephemeral project’ lasting exactly 64 concerts before disbanding. Between 2016-2022 the project enlisted a wide range of experimental musicians and artists to perform in Bristol, the UK and Europe, and released a number of the resulting recordings on labels like Avon Terror Corps and Permanent Draft."

She thus takes us on a journey into her past that reveals the phases of love, the challenge of long-distance relationships and the clash between illusions and frustrations or guilt. The film combines documentary and animation, the real and intimate, with the expressive. An apparently personal and intimate film, where the turn and evolution of the protagonist can also be read from an anthropological or political prism, reflecting the change in the role of women in intimate relationships."

To trace their presence buried in the post-industrial landscapes of this region is to find a memory of places and beings, and by this emergence of another history, to act of resistance. The practice of archaeology observed in parallel to this quest, allows to open a reflection on history as a materiality as well as on the part of opacity and lack that is at the heart of our otherness."

In the last ten years, the vintage (retro) scene has expanded greatly among the young and among the middle generation, it can almost be said that it has become fashionable, but by no means mainstream. The film follows original rockabilly and rock n roll bands, fashion, clothes, pin-up girls, barbers, old furniture, old items, motorbikes and a lot more – all of it gathered through interviews and events of the past years."

He observes the migratory fires set by local peasants to burn their fields and grass. The elemental structure of the landscape, the colours and reflection of the water surface emerge in the ever-changing light during the day and the seasons. The sequences and arrangements of the film develop a multi-layered dialogue between the landscape and the abandoned house. In the interior spaces of the house, in the play of light and shadow, from unexpected angles, from spots on the wall or patterns on the tiles, Jedlička reveals motifs that resonate with the physiognomy of the landscape."

This work was one of the favourites of Lidia García Millán, who deeply investigated the importance of sound in cinema. From this concern came her choice to make a type of non-narrative cinema, where sound (incidental in some of her works) was given special prominence. At the time, this led to disagreements among Uruguayan film culture agents, who sought to create a national cinema geared towards Europe. Thanks to feminist genealogies, her work is now considered a historical reference."

Yet the concept of a “crisis of masculinity” is increasingly permeating the media, with a loosening of roles and a growing uncertainty about what it means to be a man today. The director Jan Hušek also asks this question. He was still wetting himself by the age of thirteen, which earned him the unflattering nickname that is the film s title. In his open video diary, he captures the physical and spiritual transformation of his journey from boy to man. He returns to the woods and the roots of his childhood trauma. In doing so, he turns the camera on himself as well as on various teachers or his father. Perhaps the mark of adulthood, after all, is not overwrought masculinity, but the acceptance of his inner “pisspants”."

Moving residents out of the city and improving traffic flow was at the heart of this proposal... It was 1960 s Urban Renewal all over again. As tragic as the circumstances were, the threat of a road destroying the neighborhood required residents to rise to the challenge of becoming *community organizers. This movie documents 5 years of development and community organizing in Lewiston. It s an exceptional story about the people of Lewiston, but it s also a universal story about the challenges faced by many urban neighborhoods across the United States."

Within this research, the role of clouds is still the biggest unknown since we don t know if they will increase or dampen the warming.  The tiny island of Barbados, where the campaign is taking place, is at the forefront of the challenges ahead. Through the successes and failures of the campaign, Barbadians and climatologists explore the fascination that clouds inspire. Somewhere between science, history and poetry, they draw a composite portrait of research."

More than a thousand dreams about Putin have now been recorded and posted on public platforms.  In Dreams About Putin, a selection of these dreams have been brought to life using Unreal Engine, a 3D graphics program for creating scenes for computer games. In this exciting experiment with form, the animations are complemented by rare archival footage of the Russian president.  The dreams are related by a narrator, and their “translation” into 3D scenes is not literal; likewise, the archival footage has been lightly edited. The result is sometimes dryly comic, sometimes absurdist, sometimes disturbing, and sometimes even hopeful. A series of bizarre but therefore oddly familiar nightmares as a vision of Putin’s Russia."

Nonetheless, the use of the term “war crimes” is still sensitive.  This documentary reveals how far the Dutch rulers went in selling the war as a domestic affair, intended to restore peace among the population. Unique, often shocking images tell a different story. Filmmaker In-Soo Radstake holds extensive interviews with international experts who explain the complex relationships in the former colony and set out the global context."

In Autogeografía, she puts her own body in front of the camera, articulating recording and representation in an early video-performance work. Derived from her action Comunicando con tierra (where she extracted soil from the Machu Picchu which she later exchanged with other Latin American Artists), a purification ritual takes place—Minujín covers herself up in “barbarity,” soil and grains that anonymous hands throw at her from out of field. A territory for exploration where the absurd embraces the real—“The only thing that is true is what we invent.”"

With the conviction of exploring other formats, drawings and paintings from this cosmological period are animated in celluloid. Shot on 16mm film and produced in collaboration with artist Ramiro Larraín, Algunos segmentos is a plastic unit of abstract motives and color planes to the rhythm of the music by the Improvisation Group of La Plata (GILP)."

This documentary brings back one of those ignored fragments through the figure of Carlos Procopiuk, a man who inhabited, like nobody else, the ethics and aesthetics of a cinema made in a rabidly independent way. An all-terrain character who acted, wrote, produced, edited, directed and taught his community, in Neuquén between the 1950s and the 1990s, how to make films. With the memory still fresh and the eloquent images from his works, the documentary by Diego Lumerman settles a small part of that inestimable debt that Argentine film has with its history."

But at 90, Mariette decides to shed light on that past that haunts her, tell her story and reveal her true identity with the sole aim of freeing herself from those wounds that won’t heal, from that pain that never ceases. In the last part of a documentary trilogy about the Holocaust’s ghosts in Argentina, writer-director Poli Martínez Kaplun seizes one of the most powerful tools of cinema— the capability of turning into the perfect counteroffensive for omission."

Decades later, the director of this film, and the son of that guerrilla man, meets to talk with the businessman’s son and grandsons. The Businessman is made up of talks, but also of magazines, poster, flyers, photographs, newspapers, ads, home movies and objects that are also the testimony of a time; its editing makes personal memories intertwine with the story, and in it, the question of the relationship between who’s filming and who’s being filmed becomes inescapable."

But many diehard rock fans viewed disco, with its repetitive beat and culture that emphasized pleasure, as shallow and superficial. A story that’s about much more than music, The War on Disco explores how the powerful anti-disco backlash revealed a cultural divide that to some seemed to be driven by racism and homophobia. The hostility came to a head on July 12, 1979, when a riot broke out at “Disco Demolition Night” during a baseball game in Chicago."

The reason for the disputes was new natural gas reserves in the Mediterranean - but not only that. Turkey spans across Europe, Asia, and the Caucasus, giving it a strategic position in the Mediterranean region. Wars in Syria and Ukraine are raging at its borders, posing a threat to the established world order. As a significant regional power, Turkey is at the centre of conflicts in the eastern Mediterranean. In the documentary, presidential advisors, ministers, and diplomats explain the crises and rivalries in the area on the doorstep of Europe."

Dividing his work into ‘periods’ — classical, American, and the perestroika era — Konchalovsky, with the help of the cinema, embarks on a cinematic journey akin to Odysseus, ultimately returning to his own ‘Penelope’: Moscow."

It opens with Indigenous people prior to Wisconsin’s European colonization and continues through the 19th and 20th centuries. The film s second hour explores how forward-looking Wisconsinites challenged LGBTQ+ harassment and injustice in visionary ways, long before these efforts received national attention. Through organized protest, an independent press, and gay bar-centered social networks, a movement grew that helped build a coalition for legislative LGBTQ+ rights. Embracing and celebrating Wisconsin’s LGBTQ+ history is vital for protecting these hard-won human rights and expanding them to all."

The presence of women in filmmaking seldom holds the same historical notoriety as that of men, and the Pernambuco scene is no exception. In the context of \"Amor, Plástico e Barulho\" (Love, Plastic, and Noise), we find a film that serves as a testament to the marginalization of women in the creative industry, intertwining themes of consumption and the production of brega music. Hence, we use \"Feminino e Barulho\" (Feminine and Noise) as a means to share what we ve learned. Renata Pinheiro has inspired us to craft a narrative that gives voice to those who need to be heard. We are here to showcase a glimpse of them and what they represent. \"Feminino e Barulho\" is a short film about love, femininity, sisterhood, and empowerment."

People with hearing loss take these incomplete sounds and put them into words or phrases that make sense in the context of the conversation. It doesn t always work, leaving people isolated and alone. The pandemic made this worse, as masks took away their superpower - lipreading. People with hearing loss struggle to fit into the hearing world, yet there is a silver lining - meeting one another.  —Shari Eberts"

However, there are brave, determined individuals who are trying to expose the destructive, unjust, and sometimes invisible ways in which Israel exploits and oppresses Palestinians. The Law and the Prophets explains the mechanisms of control that Israel deploys to subjugate Palestinians. These mechanisms, some violent and some nonviolent, have been perfected through decades of civil and military rule of Palestinians both within Israel, and in East Jerusalem and the West Bank."

When the time is right, the cork farmers go out to harvest the cork bark from the trunks of the trees with an experienced and careful touch that has been kept alive for generations by fathers with special axes in their hands, passing on the noble craft to their sons. Strong women gather the cork in stacks and dream of a time when they didn’t have to carry it themselves, but were the cork workers’ cooks, surrounded by birdsong and scorched cork trees with nature as their kitchen. Back in the village, the owner of the plantation tries to sell the cork at ancient prices, while at the same time clashing with his daughter. Sofia Bairrão’s film is a sensuous and beautiful meditation on the Portuguese landscape, which produces more cork than anywhere else in the world."

Constantly meditate on the Changeless, the Self."

This last \"boy/girl\" scene carries a lot of weight and expectation though, since Victoria only appears in mainstream independent films, so this last scene was sure to be something different. All the while, all that Ramzi wants to find is love... Real love. Sometimes, you just have to let love in. Ramzi is leaving the \"Brock Doom\" world behind him in search of something purer and truer to his true self. As his recent past holds a grip over him, he finds his own path through remembrance, self-acceptance and ultimately, love. There is no sex portrayed in this film. There is only a casual conversation about life and love."

A Rats Arse  finally answers the question on every Northside residents lips - “Why?!” - and along the way reveals something about identity, values, community, and the people who exist within them."

Meanwhile, the fish in the Caspian Sea are coated in a thin layer of oil that merely needs to be wiped off. It used to be less dirty here, Turkan Huseyn says. When you are a child, everything seems less dirty, her friend replies.

With just a compass and road map to guide them, they navigated through rough weather, mechanical failures, public scrutiny and rumors of sabotage. Wearing breeches and goggles during the day and ball gowns in the evening, these aviators challenged stereotypes by proving women could be independent, competitive, self-sufficient, intelligent, graceful and above all, really good pilots. Breaking Through The Clouds shows actual footage from the 1929 air race, aerial recreations using planes like the women flew in the derby, interviews with legendary pilots Elinor Smith and Patty Wagstaff as well as family members of the pilots and aviation experts."

In the late 1940s he studied art in London and then spent time in Paris, and ever since he has rigorously explored a limited number of archetypal forms as well as the fundamentals of art’s languages.  Over more than fifty years William Turnbull has returned again and again to the head and the mask, to the standing figure and the horse, as well as to possibilities of pared-down, often monochromatic painting. His simple objects, which draw on both primitive and classical ideas, often combine presence and poetry in unique ways."

He was born in Laos, educated in France and has worked mostly in Britain since the early 1990s.  Much of his work now is commissioned for architectural and environmental settings, including Outhouse in Liverpool. Created like many of his large-scale sculptures with fellow artist Claire Oboussier, this is a transparent glass house (with opaque windows) which serves as a flexible social space for the people who live in the surrounding tower blocks."

Nestled amongst the lush hillsides of upstate New York sits a bluff of quartzite rock known as the Gunks. Regarded as the birthplace of American climbing, its short yet mighty wall stretches more than 9000ft... horizontally.  Established by Dan Rosanstein and Ken Nichols in 1987, the Great Wall of China route is a masterpiece of esoterica which traverses the entire wall, its greatest crux may be jug rash, bugs, and dog walkers."

Obstetrics and gynecology is a window, no matter in the countryside or in the city, the birth of life always involves the complexity and entanglement of the individual, the family and the society; life is not easy at all, and behind the births are the human feelings of the general public. With a huge story volume, through the ups and downs of the plot, presenting a compassionate perspective and emotional temperature, \"This is Life\" constitutes the most real, vivid, heart-wrenching and warm-hearted microcosm of the contemporary Chinese social environment."

His subjects include dogs and drowned bodies, creatures from legends and, increasingly in recent years, the monumental ruins of ancient Egypt. For more than fifty years, he has explored the possibilities of painting and its relevance to an uncertain world.  Produced alongside a retrospective at Tate St Ives, with additional paintings from British collections, this film profiles the artist in the Cornwall that has been his home since 1955. Filmed in and around his studio and in the coastal landscape that informs all of his work, Weschke speaks engagingly about his rich, remarkable life and about many of his most significant canvases. Like his work, the painter is serious, intense, spare – and yet also with an appealing streak of mischief."

Fourty thousand feet of celluloid later, the result is  Welcome To The Cheap Seats . A rock  n  roll experience nestling somewhere between  Slade In Flame  and  Coronation Street .  The Stuffies swap insights for insults as they discover Tartan, Polka Dot and Stadium Rock in a tale that captures the band on stage and off-guard.

The Heliades grieved for four months and the gods turned them into poplar trees and their tears into amber. According to some sources, their tears (amber) fell into the river Eridanos, in which Phaethon had fallen. According to Hyginus, the Heliades were turned to poplar trees because they yoked the chariot for their brother without their father Helios  permission."

Her earliest works are depictions of everyday objects: shoes in serried ranks, collections of lightbulbs and household hardware. Later canvases explore the process of depicting images of people, blank facades of buildings, clichés of photographic landscapes. More recent work is looser and less apparently realist."

But he was soon disenchanted with mechanical methods of production and his art in the 1970s and 1980s employed hand-worked wood and metal in intriguing ways.

Sitting in the elegant country house garden at Ragley Hall, Tin suggests a kitchen container or a hamburger and yet is at the same time defiantly abstract.  Krebber is a young sculptor from Germany who studied at the Royal College of Art and now works in London. The surprising range of his work, and the processes which create it, are revealed here as he talks engagingly about how to create “seriously flippant” objects. His art, made with diverse materials including balloons and Cling Film as well as traditional media, has a unique deadpan humour. Its effect, the artist hopes, is to make you ”smile and shiver at the same time”."

One of the vocations of the art is to create beauty. Paradoxically, beauty as a concept has almost never been used in conjunction with taste.

Eli continued to work as a shepherd and is today one of the most important producers of this cheese. Exceptional characters like Juan Mari and Elena Arzak, Eneko Atxa, Joan Roca, Martín Berasategui, Pedro Subijana and Andoni Luis Aduriz, who have absolutely no doubts as to the importance of an artisan, high quality produce that fits perfectly into their demanding culinary procedure. On the Urbía, Aralar and Gorbea mountain ranges, in the highlands of Navarre, the shepherds lavish care on their herds, their prized latxa sheep, with a view to obtaining a product of fine quality, capable of winning the annual cheese competition in Ordizia."

Using photography, video, sculpture, sound and installation, they have created a collection of work that is recognised for its distinctive vision and sensitivity to its context and the environment.  They are well known for their site-specific works, which include important public commissions, such as Horn, the giant stainless steel sculpture sited on the M8 motorway, which intermittently broadcasts poetry, music and voices at passing cars. They reflect on how these works illustrate the contradiction between the strange hybrid of wilderness and the high-tech, man-made industrial installations found in the remote landscapes of Scotland. The point at which nature and culture intersect is a continuing theme throughout their work, despite a more recent shift in geographical focus."

While at first appearing rational and functional, his complex mechanised systems in the end deny all rational function and so the viewer is forced down philosophical and metaphysical avenues to deduce a ‘rasion d’etre’.  From early works such as The Nervous System, 2002 – a monumental spinning machine that endlessly weaves a length of coloured rope into the form of a double helix, the shape of DNA – to his recent giant spiral work Continuum, 2004, the artist has attempted to visualize, among other things, the incomprehensible of human concerns, time."

Laulumaiden muisto is an emotional documentary film that tells the story of the evacuees from Karelia and their descendants who were placed in the region of South Ostrobothnia. It sheds light on how the emigrants who lost their homes were able to preserve their own identity and why Karelia still fascinates and interests future generations. The war in Ukraine, which broke out in the middle of filming, made the documentary surprisingly timely."

At the age of 80, Anthony Caro remains intensely active, working each day in his studio and overseeing every detail of an extensive retrospective at Tate.

Without taboos, thanks to the strength of courageous and intimate testimonials, this film aims to give a concrete understanding of what chemsex is: from the first time to regular practice, from the first effects to the impact on an entire life.

        "description": "Three spectacular canvases by Sandra Blow were one of the highlights of the 2006 Royal Academy Summer Exhibition. Sadly, this was her last show, as she died in August that year. This film was made in her studio in St. Ives as she was preparing to submit her works, and it captures her remarkable character and her fascinating reflections on a lifetime creating beautiful, rigorous, distinctive and joyous paintings.  Sandra Blow spent a formative year as a student in Italy in the late 1940s, and she returned to London to begin a distinguished career dedicated to developing her vigorous abstract art. In addition to paint, she worked with a diverse range of materials, including sacking, plaster and coloured paper collages, and while her work often referred to landscape and to architecture, it was always exploring ideas of pure form and colour, balance and chance, light and movement.  theEYE is an excellent introduction to contemporary artists and their work"

Beginning with a remembered experience, Hodgkin works on his seductive and complex paintings for long periods, characteristically producing richly coloured, sweeping compositions, which continue into the picture-frame itself.  These paintings uniquely straddle representation and abstraction, at the same time as they demonstrate both an awareness of history and an understanding of art’s potential today. Most recently, his interest in working in different scales, evident particularly in significantly larger paintings such as Americana and After Vuillard, demonstrates his concern to engage the viewer in new and challenging ways."

For more than thirty years he has undertaken demanding walks in many parts of the world, and drawn on his experiences to create distinctive artworks using text, graphics and photographs. He aims to “leave no trace” in the landscape, and he acknowledges that his art cannot represent the experience of a walk. “What I’m interested in,” he explains, “is presenting a sort of skeleton of something, and then the viewer fills in what’s missing, maybe from your own experience.”  Although they exhibit a striking consistency in their concerns, Hamish Fulton’s artworks can exist as large-scale wall paintings and as modest publications, as graphics to compete with advertising hoardings and as online animations. They are informed both by spiritual ideas and by political questions prompted by our uses of the environment and by specific issues such as land rights."

Conceptualizing Dan Graham’s installation “Two-way Mirror Triangular Pavilion with Shoji Screen” as diffractive model of the work, Mori sees landscape as process and inner mechanism, which is defined by our detached vision and interpreted by our bodymind. It is a panorama which continuously changes as we move along any route."

The New York Times  Mona El-Naggar takes us inside the kingdom and introduces us to three proud and dynamic women, each determined to test the bounds of her society in different ways. The setting is a city council election in Riyadh, where in 2015 Saudi women were allowed to vote and run for office for the first time. While they could finally participate, though, they could not actually campaign in public. Ladies First offers a riveting and intimate view of the complex and largely inaccessible world of Saudi women, chronicling this remarkable first effort of women to claim a place on the political stage of their nation"

They are, like the people who enjoy their services, mainly migrants, but their presence here is more sharply defined by the lack of survival options back home.

The film will look at the crisscrossing of various lives in the filmmaker s housing colony, gleaning from this microcosm a sense of how millions work, interact and struggle for a firmer foothold in an indifferent, often hostile megacity."

These words that the artist releases on RepubblicaTV, in a short time make the rounds of the Italian media. In the message he boasts to be one of the fastest guitarists in the world, to have had collaborations with international artists of the Rock and Metal scene, and to have done over 10,000 concerts over the years. It must be because of his shock statement, or because of the battered look he would never think of such a successful past.

He recently discovered a perfectly preserved mummified hand, brought back from Egypt in the 18th century. If the accompanying text is to be believed, it is that of Cleopatra VII, the last Queen Pharaoh of this vanished civilization. Could it be true? A thrilling investigation begins to solve a 2,000-year-old enigma. With the help of international experts, we retrace the path of a unique relic from archaeological excavation sites to laboratories, right up to the DNA investigation which - exclusively for this film - will enable us to uncover this strange mystery, and to understand the immutable myth built around Cleopatra."

Their stubbornness and attachment to their golden era, together with Francesc’s cantankerous personality, make them incredible endearing. This very original documentary covers some of the best Catalan cuisine ever cooked, but it is more about integrity, adherence to principles, refusal to move with the fads and, ultimately, an incredibly zest and passion for life. It is also a wonderful love story."

It is perhaps the most popular poster on student dorm walls from Beijing to Boston.  Painted in Vienna around 1908, the evocative image of an unknown embracing couple has captivated viewers with its mystery, sensuality and dazzling materials ever since it was created. But just what lies behind the appeal of the painting – and just who was the artist that created it?  Delving into the details of real gold, decorative designs, symbolism and simmering erotica, a close study of the painting takes us to the remarkable turn of the century Vienna when a new world was battling with the old."

Rich with symbolism, his work conveys the Black experience of defining and redefining the self, rejecting labels to form new collective narratives.  Offering song and music as forms of resistance, the exhibition invokes new understandings of what it means to be caught between, and to be of, multiple places. Choirs and musicians from cities across Europe give voice to a single refrain: ‘We are what’s left of us’, transforming the Curve into a collaborative space of communication. As the philosopher Édouard Glissant has written: ‘you can change with the Other while being yourself, you are not one, you are multiple, and you are yourself.’"

How has architecture been instrumentalized in the ongoing construction of a national narrative? What is the role of architects in shaping society within corrupt ecologies of power and failed financial engineering? Film becomes a plastic medium to reframe the positivism of urban masterplans and architectural monuments and formulate a social critique. Modern structures under threat of collapse stand in as protagonists to tell the story of a promised metropolis that never came to be, while the fairground acts as a lens to look at implicit collapse beyond the perimeter of the site."

His intention was to raise awareness of pollution in the Hudson River and to petition legislation that addressed the then-burgeoning climate crisis. Over 50 years later, the Clearwater remains an interactive environmental classroom—or, in its builder’s words, “a carnival, museum, and showboat all wrapped into one.” Featuring rare interviews with Seeger himself, Down by the Riverside is a beautiful, stirring tribute to the communities of people who continue to restore and preserve this elegant symbol of the Hudson Valley. As a local story of local heroism, this documentary is an inspiring reminder of all that can be accomplished when ordinary people work on behalf of their history and environment. —Ben Rendich"

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Jewish immigrants who faced conscription and consequent persecution in Europe came to Tampa – particularly West Tampa and Ybor City – and opened retail businesses to support the demand created by the rapidly expanding cigar industry. Family members and extended family followed one another here in search of a better life.  Like their fellow immigrants from Spain, Italy, Sicily, Cuba, Bavaria, and other parts of the world, the Jewish families who worked in and around the Tampa cigar industry brought with them their own traditions.  This new documentary by Barbara Rosenthal explores a variety of themes including overcoming quotas on Jewish immigration, the challenge of maintaining extended family bonds in a competitive economic environment, cultural assimilation, the nexus of anti-Semitism and segregation, and the rise of women in politics in Tampa and beyond."

The Vatican has vowed to end this threat to the male hierarchy, even forbidding the mere discussion of female priests. The papacy has reached a time of crisis and the controversy over women s role, and their place in the Church, must be addressed if the Vatican is to have any relevance in the 21st century."

        "description": "Precious. Rare. For Sale. takes a broad sweep at the presentation of nature in Vietnamese moving images from the 1990s. From being an abode for majestic and magical beasts, to serving as a backdrop for war heroics and social realist tragedies, representations of nature have been shaped by Vietnam’s changing socio-political contexts.  Reflecting on how filmmakers have portrayed the environment, Bùi questions the ethics of exploiting nature for the camera. While early ethnographic films shot by the French depicted the Vietnamese jungle as an untouched, primitive landscape, today’s images of razed forests and neatly-partitioned land plots reveal how nature has become a commodity for a rising middle-class. Captured on screen by property developers and thrill-seeking vloggers alike, nature’s images shapeshift constantly, feeding into an endless loop of mediated consumption."

Invoking the closing sequences of Ritwik Ghatak’s film, Meghe Dhaka Tara (The Cloud-Capped Star) (1960), the film explores how mountains became a metaphor not just for malaise and affliction, but also the human will to survive in the corridors of a creaky healthcare system. Framed through fissures in the dark, derelict walls of a once glorious cinema hall in Darjeeling, the events within turn, hang in liquid suspension. The same landscape becomes a haven for the tourist-turned-environmental-refugee who crawls up the winding mountainside in summer, fleeing the furnace of the Indian plains. But the haven itself is occupied by giant pile drivers pounding steel into the industrial night."

The glacial landscape of Manali has become a site where projections of the idyllic countryside are directed — rife with tropes of adventure, eroticism and romance. The work interrogates this thin layer of narrative practices, constructing tableaus of high-altitude mountains as static objects and backdrops for second-hand urban aspirations to happiness, while the precarious reality of living in a highly sensitive ecosystem spins an adventure far removed from most imaginaries."

However, demand is now causing springs to dry up, precious chalk streams to disappear, and the iconic River Cam to be badly degraded. Water companies, regulators, businesses, land owners, consumers and the government have overseen a developing groundwater emergency. Can these groups come together to ensure Cambridge has a reliable water supply without further damaging the environment?"

His father, the legendary Kazuo Ohno created another epoch-making opus in 1977 Admiring La Argentina, with Yoshito Ohno as production manager. These links are no mere coincidence. To date, we ve tended to overlook Yoshito Ohno, barely granting him the recognition he merits. Just as dance requires a lengthy gestation period in which to evolve, his dance has finally come into our field of vision, in all its freshness and stark-nakedness, linking Butoh s origins to its zenith, to a point where he now stands at a crossroads."

Inspired, she invites a few friends for a journey upstream the Han River, aiming to rediscover the mother river whose name has long been obscured.  Han River, China s third mother river, originates between the Bashan Mountains and the Qinling Range. As it flows, it nurtures a commercial golden waterway connecting the north and south of China.  This journey uncovers tales of pioneering construction, passionate departures from home, dramatic business legends, scenic views of vast farmlands, and breathtaking mountain vistas shrouded in mist."

In his appearance in Venice (1999) and a series of performances in his home in Yokohama in 2001, Ohno powerfully demonstrated that his dance embodies life in all its aspects. (Now, though physically immobile), Ohno s very presence continues to exude emotion: it overflows with facial expressions and delicate hand movements; fluid as water and changeable as the sky.  This documentary reveals what dance is truly about. Kazuo has given us something very precious."

It was presented as a crucial measure to combat the growing national obesity crisis in the United Kingdom.  However, as this documentary scrutinizes the campaign’s impact, a compelling question emerges: Has the “five-a-day” initiative delivered on its promises, or has it fallen short of its intended goals? Despite the campaign’s widespread awareness, it remains a fact that a significant portion of the population struggles to meet this dietary guideline in their daily lives."

His sensuous theatre sets make us hear music with our eyes and see colours with our ears.
