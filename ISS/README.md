# 🏗️ Software Engineering

This course moves beyond coding to the complete lifecycle of software production. It focuses on **methodologies** (Agile/Waterfall), **modeling** (UML), **design patterns**, and **project management**. You will learn how to architect large systems, specify requirements, and ensure quality through rigorous testing.

### 📅 Weekly Syllabus

The course runs on a 14-week schedule. **Seminars** and **Laboratories** are held **bi-weekly** (every second week) and are synchronized to guide you through the creation of a semester-long software project.

### 📚 Key Topics Breakdown

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to expand detailed topic list</strong></summary>

#### Part I: Analysis & Modeling
*   **UML (Unified Modeling Language):** The standard language for visualizing system architecture.
*   **Requirements Elicitation:** Interviewing stakeholders, writing Use Cases, identifying functional vs. non-functional requirements.
*   **Diagrams:**
    *   **Structural:** Class Diagrams (Static view).
    *   **Behavioral:** Sequence, Activity, and State Machine Diagrams (Dynamic view).

#### Part II: Design & Architecture
*   **System Design:** High-level architecture, subsystem decomposition.
*   **Object Design:** Detailed class design, interface specification.
*   **Design Patterns:** Reusing standard solutions (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer).
*   **Design by Contract:** Using assertions, pre-conditions, and post-conditions to ensure reliability.

#### Part III: Management & Quality
*   **Agile/Scrum:** Iterative development, sprints, backlogs.
*   **Testing:** Black-box vs. White-box testing, Unit tests, Integration tests.
*   **Configuration Management:** Version control (Git), build systems, and release management.
